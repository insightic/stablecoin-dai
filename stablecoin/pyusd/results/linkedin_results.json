As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.

As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.

As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.

As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.

Ter voorbereiding van de meest extreme Solar Challenge ter wereld (in Zuid-Afrika, dit najaar) reed hetInnoptus Solar Teamimmers meerdere kilometers door Leuven met hun zonnewagen, die afgelopen oktober wereldkampioen werd. \n\nGewoonlijk test het studententeam hun zonnewagens op private testbanen waar ze kunnen rijden zonder obstakels of tegenliggend verkeer. In Zuid-Afrika zullen de omstandigheden helaas niet zo optimaal zijn en daarom deden ze vandaag de ultieme test binnen op de wegen van Leuven: de Wijnpers was met 9% hellingsgraad een goede test. In Zuid-Afrika zal het weer wel iets warmer zijn, dus die combinatie kon nog niet getest worden door piloot Louis C. - met dank aan het Belgische lenteweer van de voorbije tijd \ud83d\ude09",

In het nieuwe gebouw zullen we tot 400 vierkante meter kunnen aanbieden\", zeggenPaul Van Dunen Koenraad Debackere vanKU Leuven Research & Developmentin De Tijd.\n\nEr zijn ook al plannen voor een \u2018communitygebouw\u2019, mogelijk met een 14 verdiepingen tellende toren, waar behalve voor kantoren ook plaats zal zijn voor activiteiten die het hele wetenschapspark ondersteunen, zoals congresruimtes en horeca. De meeste gebouwen zouden in 2026 moeten worden opgeleverd. Voor het communitygebouw wordt gemikt op 2028. \n\nMet de nieuwe uitbreiding bevestigt Leuven zijn positie als een van de belangrijkste Vlaamse clusters van hoogtechnologische bedrijven.

Dat zijn keynote inspireerde, bewees ook zijn boekenverkoop achteraf: die gingen vlotter over de toonbank dan menu nr. 42 op een vrijdagavond.Xavier Taveirnegidste het panelgesprek in goede banen waar Joris Merckx (CEO vanCITRIBEL) een 'cri de coeur' deed naar overheid en financierders om hun innovatie van eigen bodem niet zomaar te laten wegconcurreren door China. Met hun super-innovatieve mycelium kunnen ze vele markten veroveren. Maar wie wil hen steunen? Het is nu of nooit.Gwenn Sonck (\u5b8b\u60e0\u5b89)van de Flanders-China Chamber of Commerce stelde dan weer dat Chinese concurrentie ook een voordeel kan zijn voor onze economie: \"het houdt ons scherp!\". ProfessorReinhilde Veugelersvan KU Leuven stelde dan weer dat Europa nog meer met \u00e9\u00e9n stem zou moeten kunnen optreden tegen uitdagingen van buitenaf, en dat internationale openheid een must is om grote stappen vooruit te kunnen zetten.\n\nU merkt het.

As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.

As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.
