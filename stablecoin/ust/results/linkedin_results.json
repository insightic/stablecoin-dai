Meanwhile, holders of allied coins have more avenues to boost their yield, providing additional utility to the allied coin. \n\nLearn how to stake Alliance assets on Terra \ud83d\udc47https://lnkd.in/eXKhPP4W",

Our work together has ranged from analysing trust, to optimising communication to drive sales, advocacy and engagement.\n\u00a0\nThe President of Influence At Work isDr. Robert Cialdini, the author of seminal books including \u201cInfluence\u201d, \u201cPre-Suasion\u201d and \u201cYes!\u201d. In London to celebrate the 40th\u00a0anniversary of Influence, which has sold more than five million copies, Dr Cialdini joined us to talk to our clients about the power of persuasion and how short-term thinking often prevents businesses from harnessing its potential.\n\u00a0\nDuring his interview withThe Telegraph\u2019s Business Editor,Christopher Williams, he explained why he has added a seventh principle to his famous Influence model. Like MHP, Dr Cialdini is interested in how The Networked Age has changed society. One of the ironies of a digitally networked world is that more and more of the time we spend interacting with the world is as an atomised individual - from shopping, to streaming, to following the news, we do it alone. But our fundamental need to belong has not diminished, which means that Unity has become a more powerful force for brands and communicators.\n\u00a0\nUnity is the shared identity that the influencer shares with their audience. Saying \u201cwe are one\u201d is a powerful way to connect, persuade and spur people to action.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are many ways to create shared identity, fromMischief\u2019s Passion Powered Comms (Dr Cialdini revealed that a shared love of the Green Bay Packers has turned him into a Lil Wayne fan), to values-based corporate storytelling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut as our Deputy CEONick Barronexplores with him in this interview, the growing power of Unity presents some unique challenges, because groups can be quick to punish outsiders, expel the inauthentic, and polarise debates. In a world that craves Unity, it\u2019s no wonder that the BBC show \u2018Traitors\u2019 has become such a global phenomenon.",

Investing regularly in a small-cap fund through SIP allows you to take advantage of the potential for high returns.\n\nHere's how they work:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f You start by investing a small amount every month.\n\u27a1\ufe0f This amount is invested in a basket of small-cap stocks.\n\u27a1\ufe0f The stocks in the basket are chosen by a fund manager who has a proven track record of picking winners.\n\u27a1\ufe0f As the stocks in the basket grow in value, so does your investment.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Over time, your investment can grow to a significant amount.\n\nHere are some of the benefits of investing in small-cap funds with SIP: \ud83e\udd11\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Low Risk:\u00a0Small-cap funds are a relatively risky investment, but the risk is mitigated by investing regularly through SIP.\n\u27a1\ufe0f High Potential Returns:\u00a0Small-cap stocks have the potential to generate high returns over the long term.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Ease of investment:\u00a0SIP is a simple and easy way to invest in small-cap funds.\n\nInvesting in small-cap funds with SIP is a great option if you want to grow \ud83d\udcb0your wealth over the long term. \u23f3\n\n\ud83d\udcd4Example: \n\nHere is an example ofSundaram MutualFunds' - Sundaram Small Cap Fund.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 If you invested Rs 1 lakh in the scheme when it started in 2005, your investment would have grown 17 times over the past 18 years. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 The value of your investment now would be Rs 17.4 lakhs as of 18th July 2023. \ud83d\udcc6 The investment's compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is almost 17% since it began. \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\udcc8\n\nThis small-cap mutual fund scheme has created wealth \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\udcc8 17 times over the last 18 years, and other schemes have generated many more returns, but we have just taken an example of this to educate.\n\nSo, keep investing and create wealth \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\udcc8 for the long term. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nFor more information, FollowY&G Financial Services Private Limitedand comment and share.#ygfinserv#ygwealth#finance#financegoals#mutualfunds#smallcaps#investing101#investing#personalfinance#sip#sipkaromastraho#mutualfundssahihai#wealthmanagement#stockmarkets",
