If the LLC is formed or qualified after December 21, 2024, then reporting must be made with the LLC\u2019s articles of organization or application for authority to do business in New York.\n\nThe Act\u2019s requirements mirror those of the Corporate Transparency Act (the \u201cCTA\u201d), which is the new federal law that became effective on January 1, 2024 and which\u00a0we previously summarized here.

C. Alexander Boehnke de Lorraine-Elbeuf 3,720 followers On this week\u2019s episode of the Inside Crypto podcast, we had the pleasure of speaking with Bill Wolf, the CIO ofArchblock. Bill shared his fascinating journey in the world of finance and technology, and how he believes blockchain technology is a major tectonic shift in the financial markets.\n\nHe shared insights into the two main sides of Archblock - a blockchain software provider that helps people create and manage stable coins, and an on-chain software to assist with asset management. From creating#TUSD, a base layer of institutional grade stablecoins, to developing True (TRU), a utility token that underlies the TrueFi base software, Bill\u2019s journey is a testament to the transformative power of blockchain technology.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on this insightful conversation. Check out the full podcast to learn more about Bill\u2019s views on the future of blockchain technology and how Archblock is contributing to this major shift.\n\nYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gZpN9SdpPodcast:https://lnkd.in/g2cHuXt9",
