They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

Should this proposal be implemented, it would lead to an increase in Spark's DAI borrowing rates to approximately 3.33%.\n\n3) Another noteworthy proposal, initiated by Phoenix Labs, is about to be voted on to expand Spark's D3M to 20 million DAI.\nIf approved, this change would enable an extra 15 million DAI to be borrowed through Spark, without any increase in rates due to utilization.\n\n\u2192https://lnkd.in/eSpDRiuB",

Should this proposal be implemented, it would lead to an increase in Spark's DAI borrowing rates to approximately 3.33%.\n\n3) Another noteworthy proposal, initiated by Phoenix Labs, is about to be voted on to expand Spark's D3M to 20 million DAI.\nIf approved, this change would enable an extra 15 million DAI to be borrowed through Spark, without any increase in rates due to utilization.\n\n\u2192https://lnkd.in/eSpDRiuB",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

Should this proposal be implemented, it would lead to an increase in Spark's DAI borrowing rates to approximately 3.33%.\n\n3) Another noteworthy proposal, initiated by Phoenix Labs, is about to be voted on to expand Spark's D3M to 20 million DAI.\nIf approved, this change would enable an extra 15 million DAI to be borrowed through Spark, without any increase in rates due to utilization.\n\n\u2192https://lnkd.in/eSpDRiuB",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",

They can deposit stablecoins and receive Dai at a 1-to-1 rate, or deposit Dai and receive stablecoins held by the PSM at a 1-to-1 rate.\n* Direct Deposit Module (D3M): A wholesale credit line that provides immediate liquidity in Dai to lending markets in the decentralized finance space such as Aave.\n\nAll the components that make the Maker Protocol work are supported and sustained by the decentralized, open community known as MakerDAO through a decentralized system of Governance powered by MKR token holders and Delegates.\n\nFor media inquiry please contact media@makergrowth.com\n\nFor business and partnership inquiry please contact partners@makergrowth.com",
