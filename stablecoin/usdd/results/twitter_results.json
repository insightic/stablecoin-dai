Additionally, the k-dss repository is out of sync, and there are inconsistencies in the auth-checker's permission checks. To improve, regular dry runs and updates to the response plan are recommended, with a focus on more likely scenarios.",

Additionally, the k-dss repository is out of sync, and there are inconsistencies in the auth-checker's permission checks.

The most important issue is the potential resemblance to Ponzi schemes, which raises concerns despite the focus on regulatory oversight.
