                "review": "Binance has locked my account with a lot of fund for over 4 months now. I have been using Binance for over 2 years and have never violated any of their rules. One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

They suggested me to report police but they are new to this and hard to handle this. It charges much fee as well. I don't want to make this complicate and hope to resolve without the help of local police.I hope someone from Binance or global law enforcement agency that can resolve this in a short period can contact me.Chat ID: #120805724, #120845562"

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

                "review": "Binance has locked my account with a lot of fund for over 4 months now. I have been using Binance for over 2 years and have never violated any of their rules. One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.

Besides this Binance is still the most liquid exchange with best limit execution and plenty of assets, way more than in comparison to the most. The API also allows for massive data transfer in order to be used with external apps, extremely performant. Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

It has now been 4 weeks and I have contacted support agents at least 3 times since.  These people (only available via chat) have been completely useless; they cannot provide any information regarding status or timing for approval, or even if anyone has even reviewed any of the documents.They cannot escalate me to anyone who is capable of helping with the issue.  They only claim that someone from their email support team will contact me at sometime in the future but cannot provide any timing for that either.  It has been 2 weeks since my first contact with support and to date I have received no contact whatsoever.  Additionally every agent always end the chat with a flag that says \"This issue has been marked as solved\" when it clearly is not."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

As a user of their platform, I was led to believe that I was investing with reputable traders based on the labels and tags assigned to their profiles by binance themselves. However, it quickly became apparent that these labels were nothing more than a facade designed to lure unsuspecting investors.One such trader, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88', was prominently labeled as a 'Top performer' and touted as the 'best trader for new copiers'. Trusting in these endorsements from Binance, I invested a significant portion of my savings in copying this trader's trades, only to discover that their strategies were reckless and irresponsible.Instead of following sound trading principles, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88' engaged in actions that resulted in substantial losses for myself and many others. It became evident that Binance's labeling system was misleading and did not accurately reflect the trader's true performance or intentions.I urge anyone considering using Binance to exercise caution and thoroughly research any traders they may be considering copying. Do not rely solely on the labels and tags provided by Binance, as they are not accurately represent the trader's actual performance or level of trustworthiness. The most obvious evidence of this that after my loss and complaints to binance they removed those tags from that trader's account.In conclusion, my experience with Binance has been one of disappointment and huge financial loss. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid falling into the same trap and protect themselves from similar experiences.Stay vigilant and beware of Binance's deceptive trader labels."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

                "review": "[Update] Case ID #121488440I feel compelled to share my experience with Binance in the hope of preventing others from falling victim to their deceptive practices. As a user of their platform, I was led to believe that I was investing with reputable traders based on the labels and tags assigned to their profiles by binance themselves. However, it quickly became apparent that these labels were nothing more than a facade designed to lure unsuspecting investors.One such trader, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88', was prominently labeled as a 'Top performer' and touted as the 'best trader for new copiers'. Trusting in these endorsements from Binance, I invested a significant portion of my savings in copying this trader's trades, only to discover that their strategies were reckless and irresponsible.Instead of following sound trading principles, 'Jasmine_Gemhunter88' engaged in actions that resulted in substantial losses for myself and many others. It became evident that Binance's labeling system was misleading and did not accurately reflect the trader's true performance or intentions.I urge anyone considering using Binance to exercise caution and thoroughly research any traders they may be considering copying. Do not rely solely on the labels and tags provided by Binance, as they are not accurately represent the trader's actual performance or level of trustworthiness. The most obvious evidence of this that after my loss and complaints to binance they removed those tags from that trader's account.In conclusion, my experience with Binance has been one of disappointment and huge financial loss. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid falling into the same trap and protect themselves from similar experiences.Stay vigilant and beware of Binance's deceptive trader labels."

One day, they suddenly locked my account and refused to allow any fund withdrawals. I provided all the information they requested through the chat window, but they robotically repeat messages, telling me they cannot provide any information about the account review and to patiently wait.I even wrote a letter to Binance's CEO, Mr. Teng, but received no response. Additionally, their customer service is the worst. Despite numerous chats with customer support over 4 months, they mentally harassed me by deflecting issues back and forth and, in some cases, closing the case without resolving the problem, intentionally it seems.The money locked by Binance constitutes a significant portion of my family's finances. My family has been unhappy throughout these periods. Eventually, I fell into depression and had to seek treatment from a doctor due to the mental and financial abuse.This is clearly psychological abuse and financial extortion. I plan to take legal action on this matter and share my dreadful experience on social media. My case number is 121154260. If this issue is resolved promptly, I will update my review."

Positive feedback emphasizes the trustworthiness of the service, reasonable fees, and a user-friendly interface, suggesting that many customers find the service reliable and easy to navigate with a cost structure they find acceptable. However, there are significant concerns raised by some users, with key phrases such as \"bad reviews,\" \"Scam Alert,\" \"stole my money,\" \"pending ticket,\" \"no follow-up,\" and \"verification system\" indicating issues with customer service, account access, and potentially the security or integrity of the service. The negative reviews suggest that the service may have problems with responsiveness to customer issues, particularly with regards to the verification process and account access. For improvement, the service should investigate these customer service complaints, enhance their verification system, and ensure better follow-up on support tickets to restore and maintain user trust.",

Actually they are adding new features everyday and really optimising their app and system. But it's all glitches. I would suggest you never ever head to copy trading feature it's gonna ruin all of your capital and everything. This feature is just to steal peoples money. When the lead trader opens a trade you get executed within 1-2 hours sometimes right before your first position is about to liquidate and also it never closes on its own even if the lead trade has closed right after opening the trade your position will stay opened no matter if it is in profits of thousands or in loses. Also let's say you followed a lead trader and when you started following him he already had a buy positioned opened at that time.Now what is gonna happen then is that whenever he is gonna close that position you are gonna enter into a short position.Also their support is really useless in these regards that they simply admit that this happened but never say that it's a system fault."

Four stars only since the trading on the integrated platform could really be improved and enhanced by features like tickcharts, quick and precise OCOs, or a simple fullscreen-mode for the trading interface when its used in the browser."

And good luck trying to decipher their fee schedule \u2013 it's like navigating a maze designed to confuse and frustrate unsuspecting users.But the real kicker is their customer service \u2013 or lack thereof. It's like shouting into the void. When you encounter an issue, which you inevitably will, don't expect any timely resolution or even a semblance of human interaction. Binance's customer support is as responsive as a brick wall, leaving you stranded with your problems and your dwindling faith in humanity.And let's not forget about security \u2013 or the lack thereof. Binance has had its fair share of security breaches, leaving users vulnerable to hacks and theft. It's a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and you're left holding the bag when it inevitably does.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you enjoy financial frustration and existential dread. There are plenty of other cryptocurrency exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize transparency and security. Don't make the same mistake I did \u2013 run, don't walk, away from Binance. Your sanity and your bank account will thank you."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

Without any prior warning or valid explanation, they deactivated my account, leaving me completely stranded and unable to access my funds. This sudden and arbitrary action has caused me immense frustration and inconvenience.The lack of communication and transparency from Binance is unacceptable. I have been a loyal customer for quite some time, but this experience has shattered my trust in their platform. It is utterly irresponsible for a company to disable accounts without providing a clear reason or opportunity for resolution.I urge others to exercise caution when dealing with Binance. Their disregard for customer satisfaction and their apparent willingness to deactivate accounts without justification is concerning. I certainly will not be recommending Binance to anyone after this regrettable experience."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

                "review": "Binance, one of the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, prides itself on its efficient services and quick customer response times. However, recently, there has been a noticeable slowdown in their customer support department, leaving many users frustrated and dissatisfied.As a loyal Binance user for several years, I have always found their customer service to be top-notch. Any issues I encountered were swiftly resolved, and I could always count on a timely response from their team. So, when I found myself facing an unexpected problem with my account, I naturally turned to Binance for help.To my surprise, days passed with no response from their customer support team. I sent multiple messages through their website and social media channels, but all I received were automated responses assuring me that my inquiry was being looked into. Frustration began to set in as I watched my issue go unresolved, and I couldn't help but wonder what had caused this sudden delay in their usually prompt customer service.As more time passed, I started to see similar complaints from other users on online forums and social media platforms. Many were experiencing long wait times and delayed responses from Binance's support team, with some reporting that they had been waiting for weeks without any resolution to their problems.The once shining reputation of Binance's customer service was starting to tarnish, and users were becoming increasingly disillusioned with the exchange. Rumors began to circulate about possible internal issues within the company, causing the slowdown in customer support response times.Despite the setbacks, I remained hopeful that Binance would address the issue and restore their previous level of customer service excellence. As a valuable and loyal customer, I believed that they would do everything in their power to rectify the situation and regain the trust of their users.In the end, Binance did take steps to improve their customer support response times, hiring additional staff and implementing new systems to streamline their processes. The slowdown was eventually resolved, and once again, users could rely on Binance for efficient and effective customer service.Through this experience, I learned that even the most reliable and reputable companies can face challenges that affect their ability to provide top-notch service. It is during these times of struggle that true customer loyalty is tested, and I am pleased to say that Binance passed the test with flying colors in my book."

What started as a promising platform for cryptocurrency trading has quickly devolved into a nightmare of lost funds and abysmal customer service.This morning, I reached out to Binance's customer service regarding a glaring discrepancy in my account. Despite depositing approximately $950 into my Ethereum account and only withdrawing around $350, there's a glaring gap of $600 or $550, considering fees. Basic arithmetic, right? Not according to Binance's customer service team, who seemed intent on gaslighting me into doubting my own sanity.Their feeble attempts at explanation, pointing fingers at Bitcoin transactions and other vague excuses, only compounded my frustration. The ledger doesn't lie, and there's simply no accounting for the missing funds. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency and accountability from a platform I once trusted with my investments.To add insult to injury, my account balance now reads a measly $28, a laughable sum considering the significant investment I've made. It feels like nothing short of robbery. In light of this egregious mishandling of funds and appalling customer service, I've withdrawn over $10,000 from Binance and vowed never to return.In conclusion, steer clear of Binance unless you want to risk losing your hard-earned money to a company that seems more interested in making excuses than resolving issues. Trust is the bedrock of any financial institution, and unfortunately, Binance has shattered that trust beyond repair."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out.

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats.

I have all the evidence I need to assist your Turkey problem and I know everything about how you staff can access devices to control the narrative. I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out. They say they can\u2019t delete account history either but I have proof they did. Please help me everyone. It\u2019s nearly killed me. HELP"

I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification.

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats. As for the order, just look at my last p2p transactions. its the last 2 both with the same guy. one cancelled where he just took the money and ran without you giving a damn you scum...the case ID for your inquiry is  123807477"

I have all the evidence I need to assist your Turkey problem and I know everything about how you staff can access devices to control the narrative. I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out. They say they can\u2019t delete account history either but I have proof they did. Please help me everyone. It\u2019s nearly killed me. HELP"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats. As for the order, just look at my last p2p transactions. its the last 2 both with the same guy. one cancelled where he just took the money and ran without you giving a damn you scum...the case ID for your inquiry is  123807477"

I have all the evidence I need to assist your Turkey problem and I know everything about how you staff can access devices to control the narrative. I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out. They say they can\u2019t delete account history either but I have proof they did. Please help me everyone. It\u2019s nearly killed me. HELP"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats. As for the order, just look at my last p2p transactions. its the last 2 both with the same guy. one cancelled where he just took the money and ran without you giving a damn you scum...the case ID for your inquiry is  123807477"

I have all the evidence I need to assist your Turkey problem and I know everything about how you staff can access devices to control the narrative. I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out. They say they can\u2019t delete account history either but I have proof they did. Please help me everyone. It\u2019s nearly killed me. HELP"

Their support is an AI chat bot and it is useless. To sell about USD600 worth of BTC directly to Binance and not through P2P on the Binance app, I tapped on Trade/Sell/ Sell BTC and chose bank transfer to my NZ bank account. The transaction went through; however, I didn't receive any notification or message confirming whether the transaction was completed. I saw on their guide page that it would take up to 5 days to receive your money, but it has been a a month, and I have not heard from anyone and haven't received my money.I cannot find any support channel from Binance either. This app is a scam."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats.

I am taking this story as far as I can reach for justiceBinance Australia actually allowed my account to be used by some Asian crime syndicate who infiltrated my phone and accounts. They traded, swapped, sold, bought, mined, and transferred assets well over $25 million AUS. When I  discovered my balance I had to spend the whole night holding these scum bags out until I could get someone to message binance to lock my account. I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me. They now say they hav to follow guidelines which only happens when it is in their favour.please if anyone can help me bring them to justice and honour the agreement they made please reach out.

Their support is an AI chat bot and it is useless. To sell about USD600 worth of BTC directly to Binance and not through P2P on the Binance app, I tapped on Trade/Sell/ Sell BTC and chose bank transfer to my NZ bank account. The transaction went through; however, I didn't receive any notification or message confirming whether the transaction was completed. I saw on their guide page that it would take up to 5 days to receive your money, but it has been a a month, and I have not heard from anyone and haven't received my money.I cannot find any support channel from Binance either.

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Since June 1st, 2024, Binance has inexplicably blocked my deposits without any clear reason. Despite being able to withdraw funds, the lack of transparency and communication from their support team is unacceptable.Every time I contact their support, I receive the same vague response: \"your case is under review.\" No additional details or timelines are provided. I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification. This prompted me to move all my funds to my Ledger hardware wallet for safety.As a result, I no longer trust Binance and strongly advise others to consider safer alternatives like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Binance's current practices are not only unreliable but also unsafe.Cons:Blocked deposits without clear reason.Unhelpful and repetitive support responses.Numerous reports of similar issues from other users.I hope Binance addresses these issues promptly, but until then, I cannot recommend their services.Case ID #122977425"

And Binances reaction to that? Couldnt care less.....let the thief go without any action taken against him and actually even blocked my account instead. Cooperating with the thief claiming i owe them for the transaction despite being provided all the proof to the contrary. And their customer support when asked to fix their mistake and unblock my account? An absolute bunch of incompetent a-holes every single one of them!!! making absolutely irrelevant request to prove something and then when given all the proof they asked for.....rejecting it for no reason. So no wonder criminals like it so much when Binance themselves are nothing more then a bunch or criminals. STAY AWAY from these morrons ppl!!!!in the end, lost a ton of money there tu binance supported scammers and then  lost what was left directly to binance who straight up confiscated...aka...stole the rest of my money-----------------------no you dont apply any security measures. your P2P FAQs say that if the seller doesnt release that the order will be released manually by the Binance customer service agent.but when i reported the theft you let him go, didnt release manually anything and instead blocked my account trying to steal what little i have left there yourselves.If there was an award for BAD service, you would win it by miles. you truly are by far the worse criminal service in the history of services.you can find the irrefutable evidence of your criminal behavior here and all related chats.

I thought it was all safe until they gave access back to them. Firstly why wasn\u2019t the account Locked to verify that amount being legitimate by anyone. The CS agents then asked me to make a video saying the money was mine so they could cover it up. Then after unlocking my account it was totally drained and the agents told me not to report this to the police and they would help sort me out. This is when I learnt binance have remote access to all devices as the cs agent was trying to direct me to various links to steal and load my account. They were snapping up Ronald NFTs on YouTube, . When I tried to report this they crashed my phone so I couldn\u2019t and no care that I care for my disabled parents. Honestly I hate them thy have ruined my life an should have compensated me.

Their support is an AI chat bot and it is useless. To sell about USD600 worth of BTC directly to Binance and not through P2P on the Binance app, I tapped on Trade/Sell/ Sell BTC and chose bank transfer to my NZ bank account. The transaction went through; however, I didn't receive any notification or message confirming whether the transaction was completed. I saw on their guide page that it would take up to 5 days to receive your money, but it has been a a month, and I have not heard from anyone and haven't received my money.I cannot find any support channel from Binance either.

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back. Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

I have reached out multiple times each day, hoping for a resolution, but to no avail.I turned to various platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot, and found numerous posts from other users experiencing similar issues with Binance freezing accounts without justification.

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back. Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Unfortunately, I did not receive a response via email, and I encountered technical issues with the live chat system. As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process. I have not received further assistance despite my numerous attempts and providing ample identification."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back. Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

I purchased $2000 of NFT's on that platform, thinking it was safe. Over a year later, without any warning or reason given, Binance BANNED all of my NFT's. All 13 of them. I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Unfortunately, I did not receive a response via email, and I encountered technical issues with the live chat system. As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process. I have not received further assistance despite my numerous attempts and providing ample identification."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back. Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

I cannot do anything with them at all except transfer them out of Binance, and you have to pay (yes you guessed it) Binance to withdraw the NFT's that you cannot otherwise list or trade in any way.A reputable company firstly would have given even a basic reason as to why they decided to ban $2000 of NFT's, or at least when asked be able to give a reason. And secondly, any reputable company would not seek to make a profit by charging to remove the NFT's from the platform after its them who banned it without any reason given!Their agent made a mistake not realising I hadn't already removed them, saying to me that once my assets are removed from the platform they can't offer me compensation, acting smug as if he was going to help anyway. Then he realised they were still on the platform! Hurrah, sounds like I'd be compensated right? WRONG! He then said they can't do anything and it's impossible to compensate me. Final thing, they're banned in the USA already. They're NOT registered with the FCA in the UK either. The UK and other nations need to take action to take this platform down. Its a total fraud."

Unfortunately, I did not receive a response via email, and I encountered technical issues with the live chat system. As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process. I have not received further assistance despite my numerous attempts and providing ample identification."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

I transferred an additional amount by mistake to a person who was selling USDT to me on the p2p market. The guy was using a third party to receive the order amount (an account used in fraudulent operations and the bank told me about this), and he created an account that was not registered in his name.  In the payment methods, an amount equivalent to 418 USDT was transferred by mistake. Support refused to suspend the seller\u2019s account for 3 days and I sent him all the evidence of the transfer and that the seller is a fraud and the account he uses is a fraudulent account and they were informed by the authorities. They understood the matter after 3 days and blocked it.  The seller\u2019s account and crediting a balance equal to the amount of the dispute. They said that after 3 days, if the seller does not respond, we will transfer the currencies to your account manually. I sent them a disclaimer for the seller to sign. The seller refused to sign and they did not force him to disclaim my responsibility for sending money to an account in which fraudulent operations are taking place.  People, within three days, the seller responded to the chat and to his local number saying that he would not refund the amount, and the chat about the order was all insults and insults from the seller. Three days have passed and the customer service employees refuse to take any additional action. They also promised to transfer the currencies manually and tell me other imaginary solutions that are difficult.  To be applied in Egypt, and I told them my experience with the solutions they sent and they ask for documentation of the police\u2019s refusal to open an investigation and things that indicate that they are amateurs who do not know the meaning of customer service. I sent them evidence that the customer is fraudulent and has defrauded many customers, but they refuse anything and respond with provocative messages, saying:  They will not transfer the currencies until the seller contacts them, and they know that he is a fraudster and they see that he is responding to the conversation regarding the request, but they are protecting the right of a fraudster who does not want to return my money. A very bad experience, even though I am a verified trader in Binance, but I do not know why the stubbornness, instead of being compensated.  Because you leave fraudsters and scammers on your platform, they refuse to help me. This is strange and strange and cannot be believed from a platform that considers itself a pioneer in the field of crypto currencies, Its employees do not know anything about customer service and apply imaginary rules and insist that the rules have worked for people all over the world. I tried to implement what they asked, but to no avail, because the laws in my country do not recognize digital currencies and call them fraud, so how can they file a lawsuit?  For someone who went to the one who was swindled, and they have a rule called the law that does not protect fools"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

Unfortunately, I did not receive a response via email, and I encountered technical issues with the live chat system. As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process. I have not received further assistance despite my numerous attempts and providing ample identification."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

I transferred an additional amount by mistake to a person who was selling USDT to me on the p2p market. The guy was using a third party to receive the order amount (an account used in fraudulent operations and the bank told me about this), and he created an account that was not registered in his name.  In the payment methods, an amount equivalent to 418 USDT was transferred by mistake. Support refused to suspend the seller\u2019s account for 3 days and I sent him all the evidence of the transfer and that the seller is a fraud and the account he uses is a fraudulent account and they were informed by the authorities. They understood the matter after 3 days and blocked it.  The seller\u2019s account and crediting a balance equal to the amount of the dispute. They said that after 3 days, if the seller does not respond, we will transfer the currencies to your account manually. I sent them a disclaimer for the seller to sign. The seller refused to sign and they did not force him to disclaim my responsibility for sending money to an account in which fraudulent operations are taking place.  People, within three days, the seller responded to the chat and to his local number saying that he would not refund the amount, and the chat about the order was all insults and insults from the seller. Three days have passed and the customer service employees refuse to take any additional action. They also promised to transfer the currencies manually and tell me other imaginary solutions that are difficult.  To be applied in Egypt, and I told them my experience with the solutions they sent and they ask for documentation of the police\u2019s refusal to open an investigation and things that indicate that they are amateurs who do not know the meaning of customer service. I sent them evidence that the customer is fraudulent and has defrauded many customers, but they refuse anything and respond with provocative messages, saying:  They will not transfer the currencies until the seller contacts them, and they know that he is a fraudster and they see that he is responding to the conversation regarding the request, but they are protecting the right of a fraudster who does not want to return my money. A very bad experience, even though I am a verified trader in Binance, but I do not know why the stubbornness, instead of being compensated.  Because you leave fraudsters and scammers on your platform, they refuse to help me. This is strange and strange and cannot be believed from a platform that considers itself a pioneer in the field of crypto currencies, Its employees do not know anything about customer service and apply imaginary rules and insist that the rules have worked for people all over the world. I tried to implement what they asked, but to no avail, because the laws in my country do not recognize digital currencies and call them fraud, so how can they file a lawsuit?  For someone who went to the one who was swindled, and they have a rule called the law that does not protect fools"

The deposit was made to the thief's Binance account and I requested the refund to Binance but they asked me to come with law enforcement. I totally understand this, so I contacted law enforcement for help and they agreed to work on my case. (Remember, I pay them by the hour). What happened next? Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t. Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds. NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!"

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

Unfortunately, I did not receive a response via email, and I encountered technical issues with the live chat system. As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process. I have not received further assistance despite my numerous attempts and providing ample identification."

I transferred an additional amount by mistake to a person who was selling USDT to me on the p2p market. The guy was using a third party to receive the order amount (an account used in fraudulent operations and the bank told me about this), and he created an account that was not registered in his name.  In the payment methods, an amount equivalent to 418 USDT was transferred by mistake. Support refused to suspend the seller\u2019s account for 3 days and I sent him all the evidence of the transfer and that the seller is a fraud and the account he uses is a fraudulent account and they were informed by the authorities. They understood the matter after 3 days and blocked it.  The seller\u2019s account and crediting a balance equal to the amount of the dispute. They said that after 3 days, if the seller does not respond, we will transfer the currencies to your account manually. I sent them a disclaimer for the seller to sign. The seller refused to sign and they did not force him to disclaim my responsibility for sending money to an account in which fraudulent operations are taking place.  People, within three days, the seller responded to the chat and to his local number saying that he would not refund the amount, and the chat about the order was all insults and insults from the seller. Three days have passed and the customer service employees refuse to take any additional action. They also promised to transfer the currencies manually and tell me other imaginary solutions that are difficult.  To be applied in Egypt, and I told them my experience with the solutions they sent and they ask for documentation of the police\u2019s refusal to open an investigation and things that indicate that they are amateurs who do not know the meaning of customer service. I sent them evidence that the customer is fraudulent and has defrauded many customers, but they refuse anything and respond with provocative messages, saying:  They will not transfer the currencies until the seller contacts them, and they know that he is a fraudster and they see that he is responding to the conversation regarding the request, but they are protecting the right of a fraudster who does not want to return my money. A very bad experience, even though I am a verified trader in Binance, but I do not know why the stubbornness, instead of being compensated.  Because you leave fraudsters and scammers on your platform, they refuse to help me. This is strange and strange and cannot be believed from a platform that considers itself a pioneer in the field of crypto currencies, Its employees do not know anything about customer service and apply imaginary rules and insist that the rules have worked for people all over the world. I tried to implement what they asked, but to no avail, because the laws in my country do not recognize digital currencies and call them fraud, so how can they file a lawsuit?  For someone who went to the one who was swindled, and they have a rule called the law that does not protect fools"

Binance asked LE to send the lawyer's letter and they prepared and sent it. But Binance said we should register in the Kodex and contact Binance there. Okay. Now I should get LE to register in Kodex and verify there. But Kodex does not answer for about a month. I asked for help from Binance to move faster, but they just say we should raise ticket on Kodex. I have already paid a lot of money for a help from Law Enforcement and I should pay more? What if Kodex never answers? Is Binance scamming me to get my money? Are they waiting for me to die? Should I wait forever? No. Furthermore, they keep saying they are doing their best to resolve my case, but there is no any small progress for 3 months. Customer service replies with fixed template like chatbot I strongly suggest that Binance find another way to resolve this kind of issue faster. It is better than deceiving customers. Please someone from Law enforcement contact me to resolve my case. I will continue to post everywhere I can until I get a refund from Binance. I don't want to get a response from Binance here to my post as they are pretending to be honest and willing to resolve as soon as possible. I already faced this in my last post."

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair! Just dreadful!"

As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t. Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds. NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!"

Unfortunately, I did not receive a response via email, and I encountered technical issues with the live chat system. As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process. I have not received further assistance despite my numerous attempts and providing ample identification."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

As a visitor, the system failed to send verification codes to my email or phone number, which led me to give up on that approach.In my quest for a solution, I found the email address in the privacy section of Binance's website and sent a detailed request there, including multiple forms of identification and proof of address. I provided all necessary details to verify my identity and prove I am the account holder. However, the only response I received was a request for the last location from which I accessed my account, which is difficult to provide due to the use of privacy protection measures.I understand the importance of security, but I believe it should be applied reasonably based on the specific case. In my situation, I am not requesting sensitive information, as I have already provided my own data. I am simply asking for my transaction history, which is crucial for my tax purposes.Unfortunately, I do not have a Case ID, as I have not been provided with one during this process.

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t. Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds. NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t.Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds.NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!UPDATE 24 JULY 2024:Another week has passed and I was requested to provide another bunch of SAME proofs AGAIN. Support keeps waiting for a response from the scam-seller, and it doesn't seem they understand that no response (and valid proofs) will be provided from the scammer, but still they decide to keep my money frozen for over 4 months now... I am tired and just want to receive my money back. This is a terrible experience, support does nothing but to request for more proofs from you, wasting your time and doing nothing else. This platform is a total scam. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN! UNFREEZE MY MONEY AND LET ME BE, SCAMMERS!DO NOT KEEP YOUR FUNDS ON THIS PLATFORM! If you top up your balance there, your money don't belong to you anymore..."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair! Just dreadful!"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t.Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds.NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!UPDATE 24 JULY 2024:Another week has passed and I was requested to provide another bunch of SAME proofs AGAIN. Support keeps waiting for a response from the scam-seller, and it doesn't seem they understand that no response (and valid proofs) will be provided from the scammer, but still they decide to keep my money frozen for over 4 months now... I am tired and just want to receive my money back. This is a terrible experience, support does nothing but to request for more proofs from you, wasting your time and doing nothing else. This platform is a total scam. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN! UNFREEZE MY MONEY AND LET ME BE, SCAMMERS!DO NOT KEEP YOUR FUNDS ON THIS PLATFORM! If you top up your balance there, your money don't belong to you anymore..."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t.Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds.NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!UPDATE 24 JULY 2024:Another week has passed and I was requested to provide another bunch of SAME proofs AGAIN. Support keeps waiting for a response from the scam-seller, and it doesn't seem they understand that no response (and valid proofs) will be provided from the scammer, but still they decide to keep my money frozen for over 4 months now... I am tired and just want to receive my money back. This is a terrible experience, support does nothing but to request for more proofs from you, wasting your time and doing nothing else. This platform is a total scam. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN! UNFREEZE MY MONEY AND LET ME BE, SCAMMERS!DO NOT KEEP YOUR FUNDS ON THIS PLATFORM! If you top up your balance there, your money don't belong to you anymore..."

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

                "review": "23rd of March 2024 someone opened a order on Binance P2P with me on the amount 7 500 eur. I paid the order and then waited for the seller to release the deal, but seller told me to contact with him in telegram to discuss details. He sent me his telegram handle and asked to contact with him, which I did. I've contacted with the seller and asked to release crypto, since he received everything, but seller instead asked me to pay him a fee to close the order. Seller received payment in full and wanted to scam me for a fee.I've contacted with the Binance team and asked them to release crypto, because seller didn't want to do it and I had a proof of him being a scammer. Binance decided to ask for proof from seller and... That's it. 3 months passed and they still wasting my time waiting for the seller to provide ANY evidence. Seller one time provided invalid evidence of him logging into the bank and showing ALMOST zero balance, claiming that he never received anything, but he never really show the transaction history (he didn't even go to transaction history in the app) and ignored all the Binance requests to do so. From the other side, I provided Binance with all the evidence of payment being completed and received by the seller's bank, including evidence of seller confirming he received everything in full and just waiting for me to pay him a fee.So, 3 months passed, Binance has all the evidence of seller being a scammer, who received all the money, and they still decided to freeze crypto and not letting me get my money.Seller is still requesting me to pay him a fee and never answer Binance requests to provide ANY proof.That's it folks. If you work with Binance p2p, be sure to understand that Binance will do everything to save themselves and they don't care about your funds. Even if you paid, even if you provided all the evidence, they don't care. They are going to freeze your money forever while probably earning by using them on their platform, and you are just going to wait for eternity, for nothing.Oh, and yeah, they don't even care I am from Ukraine and that I really need this money... This is a HUGE amount of money they are freezing and they do nothing for me to receive my money back.Thank you, Binance, for robbing me for 7500 eur!Never trust in this company, never use their services, they don't care about you and your funds!My p2p order number on Binance platform is 20604863135175593984Update 14 Jul 2024:I provided all the evidence once again with fresh video proof, and the binance support confirmed in the appeal chat that they are releasing the order, but... They are \"releasing\" it already a week :)) They are literally confirmed in the chat that the order is being released, and they still didn't release me my crypto... I am asking support when are they going to really release the deal, but they keep extending the appeal for another 24 hours, and then another 24 hours, and then another 48 HOURS, etc..! Terrible support, terrible service!Update 18 Jul 2024:The order was released, but now the support froze my funds and asked me to revert them to scammer. I PAID IN FULL FOR THE DEAL, and now they want to be DOUBLE PAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I provided all of the evidence ONCE AGAIN that I paid completely, and Binance asked me to wait for the scam-seller to confirm that there is everything OK with the payment... SERIOUSLY?! SO, I paid to this scam on YOUR platform, YOU received every proof from me that the payment was done, YOU made me wait 4 months already, YOU received the proof that seller IS a scammer, AND NOW you want me to wait for him to confirm if everything is ok?!?!?!?! This platform is a b*llh*t.Binance DOES NOT care about your funds, about your payments, they don't care about YOU! They are torchuring you for months and even further, until you give up on your funds.NEVER TRUST this platform. NEVER USE this scam-binance platform!UPDATE 24 JULY 2024:Another week has passed and I was requested to provide another bunch of SAME proofs AGAIN. Support keeps waiting for a response from the scam-seller, and it doesn't seem they understand that no response (and valid proofs) will be provided from the scammer, but still they decide to keep my money frozen for over 4 months now... I am tired and just want to receive my money back. This is a terrible experience, support does nothing but to request for more proofs from you, wasting your time and doing nothing else. This platform is a total scam. I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN! UNFREEZE MY MONEY AND LET ME BE, SCAMMERS!DO NOT KEEP YOUR FUNDS ON THIS PLATFORM! If you top up your balance there, your money don't belong to you anymore..."

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

They waste unnecessary time doing absolutely nothing! They encourage people to scam the honest ones and let them appeal. As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can! If this is given the right approach and solution I\u2019ll come back here , delete this and say to people otherwise but at this moment I\u2019m dissatisfied"

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

I contacted support to understand the issue, thinking it was related to my account. The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop.

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can!

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can!

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

As long as they don\u2019t reply the appeal can stay as long as the scammer don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s encouraging people to scam and not respond to appeal if you appeal. So I bought usdt from the seller and paid him, he received payment and wouldn\u2019t release, I appealed and he sent doctor documents to show he received the same amount from someone else, he was asked to do live video he stopped replying since then and as I speak to you appeal is still on going since on the 25th of June and never going to stop. He has spent the money I sent to him and so doesn\u2019t care if appeal stays up to 2years he has nothing to loose. This app is total BS run away from it when you can!

The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email.

They've made it nearly impossible to sell your crypto on the platform, they've made all the settings really confusing. You can't just 'sell' anymore. I had LTC worth around \u00a380 it wouldn't let me sell, so I converted it to BNB which then says it has a minimum number of coins which I didn't have so then I converted it to DOGE and then there is no sell option, when I go to sell it says I have no DOGE! You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

You have to move it from spot account to funding account or something and even when you do that it still doesn't allow you to sell to the market but you have to use their P2P platform which then offers \u00a350. At this I've lost the will to live and just accepted the price and sold but no payment was received. The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair!

This platform has more of a potential to wreck you if you are coming in novice this platform is vicious for swing trading. The probability of losing trades along with costly fees really can take a negative impact on your portfolio. 98% of the time my diligent  timed entry points seem to pause or stop a trade most of the time where it will either crash even if the market is on the rise and the possibility of manipulation is becoming more noticeable as the years have progressed. In all honesty I will state clearly this platform has more of a chance to deplete your portfolio and work against your favor whether the market is up or down and should be treated with high risk caution \u26a0\ufe0f"

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

The app had a 2 hour timer for the payment to be made, I woke up and checked after some 10 hours and still no payment. The option I have is to 'confirm payment received' If you go to their support it's just a bot offering you loads of support blogs depending on what you type.Thank god it's only \u00a380, if this was my main account I'd be losing my hair! Just dreadful!"

My counterparty is always unresponsive or sending 1 pdf and refused to send the video from the start to now. The customer service asked me to have proof in writing from the bank that the payment was success which I did and sent to them. But still case not solved.

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

I contacted support to understand the issue, thinking it was related to my account. The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

The customer support keeps taking me round and round.. I shared all the proof bank statements receipts screenshots video recording proof but still no help. My counterparty is always unresponsive or sending 1 pdf and refused to send the video from the start to now. The customer service asked me to have proof in writing from the bank that the payment was success which I did and sent to them. But still case not solved. I really think that Binance is now in collaboration with scammers"

                "review": "2 things I've experienced with the Binance trading platform Firstly there is a high probability you may experience losing money either by buying in what you may consider was a good entry point followed by and paying a rather hefty exit fee for every trade and losing to dumps yourve invested in.Secondly  After losing multiple trades you may start to experience regret doubt disappointment or even failure due to losing your hard earned cash on a platform designed to rape your assets  Final conclusion After 10 years I have taken into consideration that I have lost trust in this platform and can confirm first hand it unfairness and manipulated algorithms over the past 3 years have been a disaster. The pumps and dumps on favored coins are manipulated and I am 100% sure it  has found a way to continuously deplete portfolios. To any novice trader I recommend steering clear from this platform  it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exits and not even bat an eye lid at your loses.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ...it will crash on your buy ins on purpose and one only needs to experience the manipulation first hand. You will notice by the bad feedback that I am not the only one  being impacted by these repetitive scams. Do not think for one second this platform is working for your best interests because I can assure you like many others it also wants to hang you out to dry Good luck"

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

I contacted support to understand the issue, thinking it was related to my account. The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

The pumps and dumps on favored coins are manipulated and I am 100% sure it  has found a way to continuously deplete portfolios. To any novice trader I recommend steering clear from this platform  it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exits and not even bat an eye lid at your loses.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ...it will crash on your buy ins on purpose and one only needs to experience the manipulation first hand. You will notice by the bad feedback that I am not the only one  being impacted by these repetitive scams. Do not think for one second this platform is working for your best interests because I can assure you like many others it also wants to hang you out to dry Good luck"

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

I contacted support to understand the issue, thinking it was related to my account. The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

When I asked them, the sender's address was on the blacklist and that's why they closed my account. My account has been locked for exactly 45 days and I cannot withdraw the money in it. Most likely, Binance confiscates people's money with such excuses. I contacted support about 6 or 7 times, but they always delay me and keep saying a different day for when my account will be opened.

Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low!

I contacted support to understand the issue, thinking it was related to my account. The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

I recommend steering clear from this platform, due to experiencing more than my fair share of pumps and dumps. I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

I recommend steering clear from this platform, due to experiencing more than my fair share of pumps and dumps. I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

I recommend steering clear from this platform, due to experiencing more than my fair share of pumps and dumps. I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

The customer service asked me to have proof in writing from the bank that the payment was success which I did and sent to them. But still case not solved.

Ignored too many red flags on account with super suspicious  activities, allowing to buy NFT for $1000 and immediately sell for $2. Denied any responsibility, chat support is very little use, takes days with agents putting you on hold, transfering and keeping beating around the bush, not answering questions and refusing to give details. Sad to see when once great company is going so low! Would not ever use this platform if it cannot protect users, will not supply any other form of contact apart from anonymous chat and blame users without admitting their own vulnerabilities. Recent news about Binance founder has reported to a federal prison in California also not adding any credits to Binance."

The first time, I was told it was a technical problem; the second time, that the team was still working on it; and the third time, I was just given an excuse that the euro (\u20ac) isn't traded much on the platform. Your agents can't seem to come up with new excuses due to your incompetence in providing a valid reason. The euro isn't the only currency being traded, and on top of that, the option to sell cryptocurrencies is also unavailable. I reached out via Instagram and on the platform, but the worst part is that you don't even bother to follow up with your customers by email. Disappointing, as I used to really like the platform and even recommended it to my friends and family."

I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ? No, I just went into earn, I have no earn history.

The customer support keeps taking me round and round.. I shared all the proof bank statements receipts screenshots video recording proof but still no help. My counterparty is always unresponsive or sending 1 pdf and refused to send the video from the start to now. The customer service asked me to have proof in writing from the bank that the payment was success which I did and sent to them. But still case not solved. I really think that Binance is now in collaboration with scammers"

Like many others I have come to understand the losses occur on entry points and exit fees.After 10 years of owning crypto  I have taken into consideration that I have lost trust in this platform and can confirm first hand that its unfair and manipulated algorithms have found a way to deplete portfolios. I recommend steering clear from this platform, due to experiencing more than my fair share of pumps and dumps. I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

                "review": "I have been deeply disappointed by Binance\u2019s recent behavior, particularly their unjust actions towards Palestinian users. Instead of providing them with a simple, fair process to withdraw their assets through P2P and then close their accounts, Binance has chosen to freeze their funds without any prior warning or explanation. This kind of behavior is unacceptable from a platform that claims to be global and transparent.What concerns me even more is the troubling alignment Binance seems to be showing with certain geopolitical agendas, particularly in favor of the Israeli occupation. This makes me seriously question their stance on privacy, fairness, and human rights. Why is a global platform choosing to act in this way, especially when there are simple solutions that don\u2019t involve freezing accounts without any prior warning?I had considered moving my assets to Binance, believing it to be a safe and reputable platform. However, seeing how they\u2019ve treated Palestinians and other users in similar geopolitical situations, like what happened with Russia, I have serious doubts about their integrity. Although I am not from Palestine, I believe strongly in the right to privacy and fairness for all, regardless of nationality or political situation.I currently hold a small amount of capital on Binance, but given their recent actions, I\u2019m hesitant to increase my involvement with them. I am left wondering: how can a company that claims to respect privacy and security act in such a manner?\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2af8Update on Binance  response\u2b91 Reply to the response message related to BinanceHelloThank you for your reply, but unfortunately, what you mentioned is not accurate. I have evidence and images that prove the freezing of accounts was not limited to illicit funds, as you claim. Many regular users had their accounts frozen and their funds seized without any prior warning, and these accounts had no connection to any illegal activities.Your actions contradict the transparency that is expected from a global platform like Binance and damage the trust users once had in you. The misleading information Binance is spreading regarding this matter is unacceptable. Attempting to justify these actions as part of anti-money laundering regulations is a weak excuse, especially when users were not even given proper notifications or clear procedures before their accounts were frozen.I will be sharing the evidence I have, and I expect Binance to clarify the situation transparently instead of providing vague responses that attempt to justify infringing on users' rightsUnfortunately, the Trustpilot website does not provide a feature to upload media, so I will adjust this response"

I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ?

As a result, my Binance account was flagged and subsequently blocked. I reached out to customer support, where I was instructed to provide the conversation and supporting evidence, which I did. Moreover, I had explained that we were prepared to return the funds in question to the client, but the individual in question had signed a contract agreeing not to withdraw funds within the first 10 days. Despite this, I was still willing to refund her as a gesture of goodwill. What deeply upset me was CS Jacopo\u2019s demand for me to record a video of myself, holding my ID, stating that I wanted to pay her back. This was not only unnecessary but also insulting, especially given my history and reputation on your platform. I kindly ask that you review my account history, including any P2P transactions or other activities, to confirm that there have never been any reports of scams or issues. Additionally, this entire situation has caused me to seriously reconsider my relationship with Binance. If such treatment continues, I will be compelled to move the 500+ clients I brought to Binance, along with my 62 employees, to another blockchain platform."

I recommend steering clear from this platform, due to experiencing more than my fair share of pumps and dumps. I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

I was the victim of a clear scam through Binance's P2P platform and Binance sided with the scammer at the end of a very stressful week, the scammer, a man by the name of Federico Gorga (known for dubious digital behaviour), was able to exploit weaknesses in their security. Rather than owing to the weakness in their security protocols, they sided with a clear case of fraud. I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details. Once I performed the transfer the seller claimed I had not spoken to him on his correct TG channel. Binance support insisted that I did no intearact with the seller on TG however they have not shown any proof that this person was not the seller. They concluded their investigation on assumptions alone."

I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ?

As a result, my Binance account was flagged and subsequently blocked. I reached out to customer support, where I was instructed to provide the conversation and supporting evidence, which I did. Moreover, I had explained that we were prepared to return the funds in question to the client, but the individual in question had signed a contract agreeing not to withdraw funds within the first 10 days. Despite this, I was still willing to refund her as a gesture of goodwill. What deeply upset me was CS Jacopo\u2019s demand for me to record a video of myself, holding my ID, stating that I wanted to pay her back. This was not only unnecessary but also insulting, especially given my history and reputation on your platform. I kindly ask that you review my account history, including any P2P transactions or other activities, to confirm that there have never been any reports of scams or issues. Additionally, this entire situation has caused me to seriously reconsider my relationship with Binance. If such treatment continues, I will be compelled to move the 500+ clients I brought to Binance, along with my 62 employees, to another blockchain platform."

Like many others I have come to understand the losses occur on entry points and exit fees.After 10 years of owning crypto  I have taken into consideration that I have lost trust in this platform and can confirm first hand that its unfair and manipulated algorithms have found a way to deplete portfolios. I recommend steering clear from this platform, due to experiencing more than my fair share of pumps and dumps. I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

I was the victim of a clear scam through Binance's P2P platform and Binance sided with the scammer at the end of a very stressful week, the scammer, a man by the name of Federico Gorga (known for dubious digital behaviour), was able to exploit weaknesses in their security. Rather than owing to the weakness in their security protocols, they sided with a clear case of fraud. I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details. Once I performed the transfer the seller claimed I had not spoken to him on his correct TG channel. Binance support insisted that I did no intearact with the seller on TG however they have not shown any proof that this person was not the seller. They concluded their investigation on assumptions alone."

I was a binance user for more than 3 years, turnover of more than a million dollars during that tenure and suddenly in july 2024 my account was permanently suspended without being given a justification of which term or condition i violated. Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

So this means that I can only deposit successfully as much as I want but I can not withdraw or move the funds or assets once I deposit. Due to trust I hardly open the account but as at now this is very very uncomfortable. On dashboard I see all my funds but most of my funds are hidden secretly in unavailable.I have no open orders on trade margin or p2p. I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ? No, I just went into earn, I have no earn history. It even started showing me tutorials I have never even been in the earn section it\u2019s even telling me to subscribe.Displaced together with my family in Ukraine during this war this is not a stress I can handle mentally as we have already been through a lot"

As a result, my Binance account was flagged and subsequently blocked. I reached out to customer support, where I was instructed to provide the conversation and supporting evidence, which I did. Moreover, I had explained that we were prepared to return the funds in question to the client, but the individual in question had signed a contract agreeing not to withdraw funds within the first 10 days. Despite this, I was still willing to refund her as a gesture of goodwill. What deeply upset me was CS Jacopo\u2019s demand for me to record a video of myself, holding my ID, stating that I wanted to pay her back. This was not only unnecessary but also insulting, especially given my history and reputation on your platform. I kindly ask that you review my account history, including any P2P transactions or other activities, to confirm that there have never been any reports of scams or issues. Additionally, this entire situation has caused me to seriously reconsider my relationship with Binance. If such treatment continues, I will be compelled to move the 500+ clients I brought to Binance, along with my 62 employees, to another blockchain platform."

I was the victim of a clear scam through Binance's P2P platform and Binance sided with the scammer at the end of a very stressful week, the scammer, a man by the name of Federico Gorga (known for dubious digital behaviour), was able to exploit weaknesses in their security. Rather than owing to the weakness in their security protocols, they sided with a clear case of fraud. I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details. Once I performed the transfer the seller claimed I had not spoken to him on his correct TG channel. Binance support insisted that I did no intearact with the seller on TG however they have not shown any proof that this person was not the seller. They concluded their investigation on assumptions alone."

Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

Due to trust I hardly open the account but as at now this is very very uncomfortable. On dashboard I see all my funds but most of my funds are hidden secretly in unavailable.I have no open orders on trade margin or p2p. I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ? No, I just went into earn, I have no earn history. It even started showing me tutorials I have never even been in the earn section it\u2019s even telling me to subscribe.Displaced together with my family in Ukraine during this war this is not a stress I can handle mentally as we have already been through a lot"

I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

As a result, my Binance account was flagged and subsequently blocked. I reached out to customer support, where I was instructed to provide the conversation and supporting evidence, which I did. Moreover, I had explained that we were prepared to return the funds in question to the client, but the individual in question had signed a contract agreeing not to withdraw funds within the first 10 days. Despite this, I was still willing to refund her as a gesture of goodwill. What deeply upset me was CS Jacopo\u2019s demand for me to record a video of myself, holding my ID, stating that I wanted to pay her back. This was not only unnecessary but also insulting, especially given my history and reputation on your platform. I kindly ask that you review my account history, including any P2P transactions or other activities, to confirm that there have never been any reports of scams or issues. Additionally, this entire situation has caused me to seriously reconsider my relationship with Binance. If such treatment continues, I will be compelled to move the 500+ clients I brought to Binance, along with my 62 employees, to another blockchain platform."

The absence of negative reviews indicates a general satisfaction among users, but this could also imply a lack of critical feedback.

                "review": "Binance may be the largest trading platform, but they never openly cheat users. However, behind the scenes, Binance allegedly shares traders' real short-long positions, leverage, and liquidation levels with large whale teams. This leads to sudden pumps and dumps in the altcoin market, making it clear that true support and resistance don't really exist.For instance, if a trader opens a large long position, the whales manipulate the market to dump prices, triggering liquidation. These whales use AI-powered software to track every move and execute trades on their behalf.Trading in cryptocurrencies is no different than handing your money directly to someone else. The entire crypto trading game is rigged, and it's all fake. The big players control the market, while retail traders are left at their mercy."

I was the victim of a clear scam through Binance's P2P platform and Binance sided with the scammer at the end of a very stressful week, the scammer, a man by the name of Federico Gorga (known for dubious digital behaviour), was able to exploit weaknesses in their security. Rather than owing to the weakness in their security protocols, they sided with a clear case of fraud. I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details. Once I performed the transfer the seller claimed I had not spoken to him on his correct TG channel. Binance support insisted that I did no intearact with the seller on TG however they have not shown any proof that this person was not the seller. They concluded their investigation on assumptions alone."

Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

Due to trust I hardly open the account but as at now this is very very uncomfortable. On dashboard I see all my funds but most of my funds are hidden secretly in unavailable.I have no open orders on trade margin or p2p. I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ? No, I just went into earn, I have no earn history. It even started showing me tutorials I have never even been in the earn section it\u2019s even telling me to subscribe.Displaced together with my family in Ukraine during this war this is not a stress I can handle mentally as we have already been through a lot"

I literally mean the amount of times it will dump on your buy ins and pump on your exit points is irrefutable evidence there is some kind of foul play going on.Do not believe for one second the binance platform is fair ... like many others have experienced  it will hang you out to dry and not even bat an eyelidGood luck"

                "review": "Binance may be the largest trading platform, but they never openly cheat users. However, behind the scenes, Binance allegedly shares traders' real short-long positions, leverage, and liquidation levels with large whale teams. This leads to sudden pumps and dumps in the altcoin market, making it clear that true support and resistance don't really exist.For instance, if a trader opens a large long position, the whales manipulate the market to dump prices, triggering liquidation. These whales use AI-powered software to track every move and execute trades on their behalf.Trading in cryptocurrencies is no different than handing your money directly to someone else. The entire crypto trading game is rigged, and it's all fake. The big players control the market, while retail traders are left at their mercy.____________________________________You can't help me. Yesterday, I not only deactivated my Binance account, but I also communicated with your support team and permanently deleted my Binance Plus account and financial information.Your cryptocurrency marketplace is completely FAKE. It thrives on false promotion. None of the tokens or projects have any true ownership identity or physical office location.All altcoins tokens are created in bathrooms, bedrooms, bars or Social media platforms. Every day, new altcoins are born just to take money from small traders. Binance and their invisible large whales team control the entire market, manipulating the system, with the sole intention of liquidating traders and stealing their money.This is why only Binance\u2019s owner gets richer every day. He hasn't invented anything like Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, or Nvidia, but he's still becoming wealthier because he and his team are running a money-rigging game on the Binance exchange.I hope that soon, the U.S. Senate will pass laws to stop this market manipulation on Binance and hold your owner and team accountable for their actions.I urge everyone to stop joining and trading on Binance, and protect your money."

I was the victim of a clear scam through Binance's P2P platform and Binance sided with the scammer at the end of a very stressful week, the scammer, a man by the name of Federico Gorga (known for dubious digital behaviour), was able to exploit weaknesses in their security. Rather than owing to the weakness in their security protocols, they sided with a clear case of fraud. I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details. Once I performed the transfer the seller claimed I had not spoken to him on his correct TG channel. Binance support insisted that I did no intearact with the seller on TG however they have not shown any proof that this person was not the seller. They concluded their investigation on assumptions alone."

Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld.

I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ? No, I just went into earn, I have no earn history.

None of the tokens or projects have any true ownership identity or physical office location.All altcoins tokens are created in bathrooms, bedrooms, bars or Social media platforms. Every day, new altcoins are born just to take money from small traders. Binance and their invisible large whales team control the entire market, manipulating the system, with the sole intention of liquidating traders and stealing their money.This is why only Binance\u2019s owner gets richer every day. He hasn't invented anything like Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, or Nvidia, but he's still becoming wealthier because he and his team are running a money-rigging game on the Binance exchange.I hope that soon, the U.S. Senate will pass laws to stop this market manipulation on Binance and hold your owner and team accountable for their actions.I urge everyone to stop joining and trading on Binance, and protect your money."

I was a binance user for more than 3 years, turnover of more than a million dollars during that tenure and suddenly in july 2024 my account was permanently suspended without being given a justification of which term or condition i violated. Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

When I asked them, the sender's address was on the blacklist and that's why they closed my account. My account has been locked for exactly 45 days and I cannot withdraw the money in it. Most likely, Binance confiscates people's money with such excuses. I contacted support about 6 or 7 times, but they always delay me and keep saying a different day for when my account will be opened.

So this means that I can only deposit successfully as much as I want but I can not withdraw or move the funds or assets once I deposit. Due to trust I hardly open the account but as at now this is very very uncomfortable. On dashboard I see all my funds but most of my funds are hidden secretly in unavailable.I have no open orders on trade margin or p2p. I have never deposited USDT all my USDT was converted from other assets on Binance. I have no bank transfer history no buy and sell with card history. I have never bought ustd with p2p. I spoke to CS on Binance and the words are account under review this will take substantial amount of time. What does substantial amount of time mean ? I seriously thought it was a mistake that could be corrected once I reach CS but I was tossed from one CS to another severally until the solution they gave me was to wait for some substantial amount of time.what does substantial amount of time mean ? No, I just went into earn, I have no earn history. It even started showing me tutorials I have never even been in the earn section it\u2019s even telling me to subscribe.Displaced together with my family in Ukraine during this war this is not a stress I can handle mentally as we have already been through a lot"

The customer service asked me to have proof in writing from the bank that the payment was success which I did and sent to them. But still case not solved.

                "review": "Binance may be the largest trading platform, but they never openly cheat users. However, behind the scenes, Binance allegedly shares traders' real short-long positions, leverage, and liquidation levels with large whale teams. This leads to sudden pumps and dumps in the altcoin market, making it clear that true support and resistance don't really exist.For instance, if a trader opens a large long position, the whales manipulate the market to dump prices, triggering liquidation. These whales use AI-powered software to track every move and execute trades on their behalf.Trading in cryptocurrencies is no different than handing your money directly to someone else. The entire crypto trading game is rigged, and it's all fake. The big players control the market, while retail traders are left at their mercy.____________________________________You can't help me. Yesterday, I not only deactivated my Binance account, but I also communicated with your support team and permanently deleted my Binance Plus account and financial information.Your cryptocurrency marketplace is completely FAKE. It thrives on false promotion. None of the tokens or projects have any true ownership identity or physical office location.All altcoins tokens are created in bathrooms, bedrooms, bars or Social media platforms. Every day, new altcoins are born just to take money from small traders. Binance and their invisible large whales team control the entire market, manipulating the system, with the sole intention of liquidating traders and stealing their money.This is why only Binance\u2019s owner gets richer every day. He hasn't invented anything like Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, or Nvidia, but he's still becoming wealthier because he and his team are running a money-rigging game on the Binance exchange.I hope that soon, the U.S. Senate will pass laws to stop this market manipulation on Binance and hold your owner and team accountable for their actions.I urge everyone to stop joining and trading on Binance, and protect your money."

I was a binance user for more than 3 years, turnover of more than a million dollars during that tenure and suddenly in july 2024 my account was permanently suspended without being given a justification of which term or condition i violated. Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal?

I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details.

                "review": "Binance may be the largest trading platform, but they never openly cheat users. However, behind the scenes, Binance allegedly shares traders' real short-long positions, leverage, and liquidation levels with large whale teams. This leads to sudden pumps and dumps in the altcoin market, making it clear that true support and resistance don't really exist.For instance, if a trader opens a large long position, the whales manipulate the market to dump prices, triggering liquidation. These whales use AI-powered software to track every move and execute trades on their behalf.Trading in cryptocurrencies is no different than handing your money directly to someone else. The entire crypto trading game is rigged, and it's all fake. The big players control the market, while retail traders are left at their mercy.____________________________________You can't help me. Yesterday, I not only deactivated my Binance account, but I also communicated with your support team and permanently deleted my Binance Plus account and financial information.Your cryptocurrency marketplace is completely FAKE. It thrives on false promotion. None of the tokens or projects have any true ownership identity or physical office location.All altcoins tokens are created in bathrooms, bedrooms, bars or Social media platforms. Every day, new altcoins are born just to take money from small traders. Binance and their invisible large whales team control the entire market, manipulating the system, with the sole intention of liquidating traders and stealing their money.This is why only Binance\u2019s owner gets richer every day. He hasn't invented anything like Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, or Nvidia, but he's still becoming wealthier because he and his team are running a money-rigging game on the Binance exchange.I hope that soon, the U.S. Senate will pass laws to stop this market manipulation on Binance and hold your owner and team accountable for their actions.I urge everyone to stop joining and trading on Binance, and protect your money."

Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

I thought at first, it's a security concern since they immediately blocked my account after I made a big deposit, which I understand and I thought by chatting with Support team they would verify whatever they need and unlock my account. However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say? If my deposit was flagged why can't they inform me because it's funny I've made even bigger deposits.

                "review": "Binance may be the largest trading platform, but they never openly cheat users. However, behind the scenes, Binance allegedly shares traders' real short-long positions, leverage, and liquidation levels with large whale teams. This leads to sudden pumps and dumps in the altcoin market, making it clear that true support and resistance don't really exist.For instance, if a trader opens a large long position, the whales manipulate the market to dump prices, triggering liquidation. These whales use AI-powered software to track every move and execute trades on their behalf.Trading in cryptocurrencies is no different than handing your money directly to someone else. The entire crypto trading game is rigged, and it's all fake. The big players control the market, while retail traders are left at their mercy.____________________________________You can't help me. Yesterday, I not only deactivated my Binance account, but I also communicated with your support team and permanently deleted my Binance Plus account and financial information.Your cryptocurrency marketplace is completely FAKE. It thrives on false promotion. None of the tokens or projects have any true ownership identity or physical office location.All altcoins tokens are created in bathrooms, bedrooms, bars or Social media platforms. Every day, new altcoins are born just to take money from small traders. Binance and their invisible large whales team control the entire market, manipulating the system, with the sole intention of liquidating traders and stealing their money.This is why only Binance\u2019s owner gets richer every day. He hasn't invented anything like Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, or Nvidia, but he's still becoming wealthier because he and his team are running a money-rigging game on the Binance exchange.I hope that soon, the U.S. Senate will pass laws to stop this market manipulation on Binance and hold your owner and team accountable for their actions.I urge everyone to stop joining and trading on Binance, and protect your money."

Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response.

I have used the platform and most of its features for while and I gained their trust only for them to block my account for no stated reason. I thought at first, it's a security concern since they immediately blocked my account after I made a big deposit, which I understand and I thought by chatting with Support team they would verify whatever they need and unlock my account. However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say? If my deposit was flagged why can't they inform me because it's funny I've made even bigger deposits.

I am currently looing for alternative platforms to Binance and would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. The order was order 22664671047160545280, the seller, provided a misleading binance handle from which he provided bank details. Once I performed the transfer the seller claimed I had not spoken to him on his correct TG channel.

                "review": "Binance may be the largest trading platform, but they never openly cheat users. However, behind the scenes, Binance allegedly shares traders' real short-long positions, leverage, and liquidation levels with large whale teams. This leads to sudden pumps and dumps in the altcoin market, making it clear that true support and resistance don't really exist.For instance, if a trader opens a large long position, the whales manipulate the market to dump prices, triggering liquidation. These whales use AI-powered software to track every move and execute trades on their behalf.Trading in cryptocurrencies is no different than handing your money directly to someone else. The entire crypto trading game is rigged, and it's all fake. The big players control the market, while retail traders are left at their mercy.____________________________________You can't help me. Yesterday, I not only deactivated my Binance account, but I also communicated with your support team and permanently deleted my Binance Plus account and financial information.Your cryptocurrency marketplace is completely FAKE. It thrives on false promotion. None of the tokens or projects have any true ownership identity or physical office location.All altcoins tokens are created in bathrooms, bedrooms, bars or Social media platforms. Every day, new altcoins are born just to take money from small traders. Binance and their invisible large whales team control the entire market, manipulating the system, with the sole intention of liquidating traders and stealing their money.This is why only Binance\u2019s owner gets richer every day. He hasn't invented anything like Google, Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, or Nvidia, but he's still becoming wealthier because he and his team are running a money-rigging game on the Binance exchange.I hope that soon, the U.S. Senate will pass laws to stop this market manipulation on Binance and hold your owner and team accountable for their actions.I urge everyone to stop joining and trading on Binance, and protect your money."

I was a binance user for more than 3 years, turnover of more than a million dollars during that tenure and suddenly in july 2024 my account was permanently suspended without being given a justification of which term or condition i violated. Although i was allowed to move all my funds to an external wallet or exchange but why was i permanently terminated?. I applied to reinstate my account because i have 3 years of crypto trading history attached to my account but even my request was rejected and the decision of my account termination was upheld. This scenario really didn't just let me down on binance but i now have serious trust issues with these crypto exchanges."

Today you released an update, I'm still waiting for a response from BINANCE support and also for a response from Mr. Teng - CEO BINANCE, where I described in detail the error in your software with the sending of screenshots / i.e. on 25.9.2024 I wanted to make a selection / until today i.e.  2 10.2024 I still do not have an answer and you rudely demand to repeat the transaction in the same amount of 15% for me \u20ac6200.  I pointed out an error in your software and that you removed the error in your software, I still don't have an answer.  I am very angry because I followed all the conditions required from your side / I sent my ID card, selfie with ID card, made a deposit from my account to the BINANCE account, made a correct transfer to the wallet / There is no shame in admitting yes we have a mistake in our  software, we are working to eliminate it, on the contrary, by admitting a mistake, you become more trustworthy, we all make mistakes.

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response.

However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say?

The transaction was blocked and I had to do additional verification with the necessary documents like ID card, ID card selfie and bank statement. All the necessary documents were provided on time, then I made a deposit of 6200 euros for the circulation of funds, but this amount was blocked.I am also having trouble withdrawing funds from my account to my bank account. Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account. Please write me the exact procedure what I need to do to get this amount of money unblocked and sent to my Binance account.Best regards"

She will directly ask me, what is this whatsapp group, I dont even have Binance. Also Binance has a statement on their website that they will never contact you via whatsapp or viber.

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response.

I have used the platform and most of its features for while and I gained their trust only for them to block my account for no stated reason. I thought at first, it's a security concern since they immediately blocked my account after I made a big deposit, which I understand and I thought by chatting with Support team they would verify whatever they need and unlock my account. However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say? If my deposit was flagged why can't they inform me because it's funny I've made even bigger deposits.

The self-service options don't seem to address my specific issue, and I was under the impression that the 24/7 live chat would connect me to an actual person, but it seems to be AI-driven. Is there any way to speak with a human for assistance and get a response from an actual person? After reading other users' feedback about your service, I'm starting to question if this platform can be trusted. The number of negative reviews is overwhelming. I hope someone from your team responds to this inquiry, as I can\u2019t find any other way to reach you."

The transaction was blocked and I had to do additional verification with the necessary documents like ID card, ID card selfie and bank statement. All the necessary documents were provided on time, then I made a deposit of 6200 euros for the circulation of funds, but this amount was blocked.I am also having trouble withdrawing funds from my account to my bank account. Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account. Please write me the exact procedure what I need to do to get this amount of money unblocked and sent to my Binance account.Best regardsMichal Hrubov\u010d\u00e1k"

BUT my wife doesnt have a Binance account, but according the scammers she has and they need her ID/Passport to withdraw 1.7BTC from her account...  She will directly ask me, what is this whatsapp group, I dont even have Binance. Also Binance has a statement on their website that they will never contact you via whatsapp or viber. I have reported over 80 scamming Whatsapp groups to both Whatsapp and Binance and almost all of them are taken down within days.

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

I have used the platform and most of its features for while and I gained their trust only for them to block my account for no stated reason. I thought at first, it's a security concern since they immediately blocked my account after I made a big deposit, which I understand and I thought by chatting with Support team they would verify whatever they need and unlock my account. However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say? If my deposit was flagged why can't they inform me because it's funny I've made even bigger deposits.

The self-service options don't seem to address my specific issue, and I was under the impression that the 24/7 live chat would connect me to an actual person, but it seems to be AI-driven. Is there any way to speak with a human for assistance and get a response from an actual person?

The transaction was blocked and I had to do additional verification with the necessary documents like ID card, ID card selfie and bank statement. All the necessary documents were provided on time, then I made a deposit of 6200 euros for the circulation of funds, but this amount was blocked.I am also having trouble withdrawing funds from my account to my bank account. Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account. Please write me the exact procedure what I need to do to get this amount of money unblocked and sent to my Binance account.Best regardsMichal Hrubov\u010d\u00e1k"

BUT my wife doesnt have a Binance account, but according the scammers she has and they need her ID/Passport to withdraw 1.7BTC from her account...  She will directly ask me, what is this whatsapp group, I dont even have Binance. Also Binance has a statement on their website that they will never contact you via whatsapp or viber. I have reported over 80 scamming Whatsapp groups to both Whatsapp and Binance and almost all of them are taken down within days. If you see something that is too good...., check with Binance chat support first...."

                "review": "I had a disappointing experience with Binance. I only needed 2 TON to transfer to my Tonkeeper wallet for testing purposes. Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

I have used the platform and most of its features for while and I gained their trust only for them to block my account for no stated reason. I thought at first, it's a security concern since they immediately blocked my account after I made a big deposit, which I understand and I thought by chatting with Support team they would verify whatever they need and unlock my account. However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say? If my deposit was flagged why can't they inform me because it's funny I've made even bigger deposits.

All the necessary documents were provided on time, then I made a deposit of 6200 euros for the circulation of funds, but this amount was blocked.I am also having trouble withdrawing funds from my account to my bank account. Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account.

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

However, they informed me that they have no information in regards to the restrictions on my account and that they will contact me in future but no apparent date or estimation of review time. When I open my app it shows that my account has been suspended until 2074 which is 50 years from now is that even normal? All my fortune is locked up for no stated reason and I was asked to be patient yet it shows 50 years. If there is a violation of terms why can't they say?

Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account.

She will directly ask me, what is this whatsapp group, I dont even have Binance. Also Binance has a statement on their website that they will never contact you via whatsapp or viber. I have reported over 80 scamming Whatsapp groups to both Whatsapp and Binance and almost all of them are taken down within days.

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

The transaction was blocked and I had to do additional verification with the necessary documents like ID card, ID card selfie and bank statement. All the necessary documents were provided on time, then I made a deposit of 6200 euros for the circulation of funds, but this amount was blocked.I am also having trouble withdrawing funds from my account to my bank account. Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account.

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

The self-service options don't seem to address my specific issue, and I was under the impression that the 24/7 live chat would connect me to an actual person, but it seems to be AI-driven. Is there any way to speak with a human for assistance and get a response from an actual person? After reading other users' feedback about your service, I'm starting to question if this platform can be trusted. The number of negative reviews is overwhelming.

The transaction was blocked and I had to do additional verification with the necessary documents like ID card, ID card selfie and bank statement. All the necessary documents were provided on time, then I made a deposit of 6200 euros for the circulation of funds, but this amount was blocked.I am also having trouble withdrawing funds from my account to my bank account. Since I can't transfer to my Binance account until I make a transaction to my bank from my Binance account, it's because of the bank details used in my Binance account for the SEPA transfer.I want to receive funds to my Binance account in fiat currency so that I can make another withdrawal to my bank account. Please write me the exact procedure what I need to do to get this amount of money unblocked and sent to my Binance account.Best regardsMichal Hrubov\u010d\u00e1k"

Before purchasing, I checked Binance\u2019s minimum withdrawal limit, which was listed as 0.9 TON. However, after buying the 2 TON, I noticed they suddenly increased the minimum withdrawal limit to 6 TON! This feels misleading and unfair. As long as there are enough funds to cover withdrawal fees, there shouldn't be arbitrary limits, especially from a platform claiming to support crypto freedom. They essentially want to force me to buy more TON (which I don\u2019t need) just to withdraw my funds. To make matters worse, I contacted their support team to address this issue, and they closed my ticket without providing a response. Extremely frustrating!    the case ID for your inquiry is  1286883"

They claimed it was related to small transactions (less than $100 in total) from one of my customers, yet no prior warning was given.I immediately contacted Binance support, and they promised a resolution within 30 business days that deadline passed on October 17th. Despite contacting them at least 10 times, they kept repeating the same robotic response: \u201cThe team is working on it,\u201d with zero updates or accountability. Finally, when October 17th arrived, they asked me to wait an additional four business weeks for an answer\u2014an outrageous delay, breaking their promise and leaving my funds locked with no clear resolution in sight.On top of the delays, Binance\u2019s customer service is appalling. I saved every chat log, and the support agents were rude, dismissive, and often ignored my questions, sending automated responses instead of genuine help.After nearly two months of waiting, I still have no access to my funds, and I\u2019m concerned Binance may be targeting high-value accounts due to potential internal liquidity issues.

Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it.

Out of nowhere, Binance locked my account, freezing over half a million dollars of my funds. They claimed it was related to small transactions (less than $100 in total) from one of my customers, yet no prior warning was given.I immediately contacted Binance support, and they promised a resolution within 30 business days that deadline passed on October 17th. Despite contacting them at least 10 times, they kept repeating the same robotic response: \u201cThe team is working on it,\u201d with zero updates or accountability. Finally, when October 17th arrived, they asked me to wait an additional four business weeks for an answer\u2014an outrageous delay, breaking their promise and leaving my funds locked with no clear resolution in sight.On top of the delays, Binance\u2019s customer service is appalling. I saved every chat log, and the support agents were rude, dismissive, and often ignored my questions, sending automated responses instead of genuine help.After nearly two months of waiting, I still have no access to my funds, and I\u2019m concerned Binance may be targeting high-value accounts due to potential internal liquidity issues. This is unacceptable, and I urge anyone with large sums on Binance to think twice before trusting this platform.Avoid Binance at all costs!I Will edit my Post within the journey of me and binance , all chatlogs will be posted on my twitter incase bad experience continues to persist"

Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it.

Out of nowhere, Binance locked my account, freezing over half a million dollars of my funds. They claimed it was related to small transactions (less than $100 in total) from one of my customers, yet no prior warning was given.I immediately contacted Binance support, and they promised a resolution within 30 business days that deadline passed on October 17th. Despite contacting them at least 10 times, they kept repeating the same robotic response: \u201cThe team is working on it,\u201d with zero updates or accountability. Finally, when October 17th arrived, they asked me to wait an additional four business weeks for an answer\u2014an outrageous delay, breaking their promise and leaving my funds locked with no clear resolution in sight.On top of the delays, Binance\u2019s customer service is appalling. I saved every chat log, and the support agents were rude, dismissive, and often ignored my questions, sending automated responses instead of genuine help.After nearly two months of waiting, I still have no access to my funds, and I\u2019m concerned Binance may be targeting high-value accounts due to potential internal liquidity issues. This is unacceptable, and I urge anyone with large sums on Binance to think twice before trusting this platform.Avoid Binance at all costs!I Will edit my Post within the journey of me and binance , all chatlogs will be posted on my twitter incase bad experience continues to persist 10/23/2024 : Still no updates whatsoever , 0 emails , 0 Response , 0 follow ups."

The overall sentiment of the reviews is negative, primarily due to trust issues and withdrawal problems, particularly at Gate.io, where users express concerns about blocked withdrawals and potential loss of funds. Product quality and customer service are recurring themes, with users often dissatisfied with the level of support and responsiveness from the service providers. Standout issues include the lack of transparency and communication, which exacerbate users' frustrations and mistrust. To improve, companies should focus on enhancing customer service, ensuring transparent communication, and addressing withdrawal issues promptly to rebuild trust and confidence among users. Further investigation into the specific causes of withdrawal problems and trust issues could provide deeper insights for targeted improvements.",

They saying it is for protecting account and for account safety. But it is their way to scam so that user cann't withdraw money and they become profitable. A sh.it way to scam.I prefer everyone to use bitget, kucoin or other platforms instead of binance. Binance really doing sh.it. Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it. If they will not do that I don't suggest anyone to use this sh.it platform"

Out of nowhere, Binance locked my account, freezing over half a million dollars of my funds. They claimed it was related to small transactions (less than $100 in total) from one of my customers, yet no prior warning was given.I immediately contacted Binance support, and they promised a resolution within 30 business days that deadline passed on October 17th. Despite contacting them at least 10 times, they kept repeating the same robotic response: \u201cThe team is working on it,\u201d with zero updates or accountability. Finally, when October 17th arrived, they asked me to wait an additional four business weeks for an answer\u2014an outrageous delay, breaking their promise and leaving my funds locked with no clear resolution in sight.On top of the delays, Binance\u2019s customer service is appalling. I saved every chat log, and the support agents were rude, dismissive, and often ignored my questions, sending automated responses instead of genuine help.After nearly two months of waiting, I still have no access to my funds, and I\u2019m concerned Binance may be targeting high-value accounts due to potential internal liquidity issues. This is unacceptable, and I urge anyone with large sums on Binance to think twice before trusting this platform.Avoid Binance at all costs!I Will edit my Post within the journey of me and binance , all chatlogs will be posted on my twitter incase bad experience continues to persist 10/23/2024 : Still no updates whatsoever , 0 emails , 0 Response , 0 follow ups. 10/24 : Customer service told me there are 0 Updates from superior team , This is really messed up . while binance replies to reviews on trustpilot , they dont do anything but give fake promises"

They saying it is for protecting account and for account safety. But it is their way to scam so that user cann't withdraw money and they become profitable. A sh.it way to scam.I prefer everyone to use bitget, kucoin or other platforms instead of binance. Binance really doing sh.it. Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it. If they will not do that I don't suggest anyone to use this sh.it platform"

I would be supprized if BInance owner was involved with the Luna token and their investment tactics to take your hard yearned money.

Out of nowhere, Binance locked my account, freezing over half a million dollars of my funds. They claimed it was related to small transactions (less than $100 in total) from one of my customers, yet no prior warning was given.I immediately contacted Binance support, and they promised a resolution within 30 business days that deadline passed on October 17th. Despite contacting them at least 10 times, they kept repeating the same robotic response: \u201cThe team is working on it,\u201d with zero updates or accountability. Finally, when October 17th arrived, they asked me to wait an additional four business weeks for an answer\u2014an outrageous delay, breaking their promise and leaving my funds locked with no clear resolution in sight.On top of the delays, Binance\u2019s customer service is appalling. I saved every chat log, and the support agents were rude, dismissive, and often ignored my questions, sending automated responses instead of genuine help.After nearly two months of waiting, I still have no access to my funds, and I\u2019m concerned Binance may be targeting high-value accounts due to potential internal liquidity issues. This is unacceptable, and I urge anyone with large sums on Binance to think twice before trusting this platform.Avoid Binance at all costs!I Will edit my Post within the journey of me and binance , all chatlogs will be posted on my twitter incase bad experience continues to persist 10/23/2024 : Still no updates whatsoever , 0 emails , 0 Response , 0 follow ups. 10/24 : Customer service told me there are 0 Updates from superior team , This is really messed up . while binance replies to reviews on trustpilot , they dont do anything but give fake promises"

They told me 4 months ago that my case was escalated and top priority. They are still reviewing it.See my review on Trustpilot. My case is still being reviewed."

Crypocurrency was created with full access and permission, thus giving everyone a fair chance at making geniune wealth and money. Not by scamming random countries and then pulling out of investments with their 51% attacks and or mass buy-outs and sell orders. I would be supprized if BInance owner was involved with the Luna token and their investment tactics to take your hard yearned money. There are three major tokens to question and everyone knows who they are when you follow the blockchain."

They saying it is for protecting account and for account safety. But it is their way to scam so that user cann't withdraw money and they become profitable. A sh.it way to scam.I prefer everyone to use bitget, kucoin or other platforms instead of binance. Binance really doing sh.it. Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it. If they will not do that I don't suggest anyone to use this sh.it platform"

                "review": "They are basically technological scammers. If you want to lose your money, this is the place for you. There is not a single free operation, whatever you do you pay, even to deposit money you have to pay (while no forex broker dreams of making you pay on deposits). The simple conversion of currencies has a spread (which is not visible) of 2%. A small commission can be there but 2% is a huge amount for all mechanized operations at 0 cost for them.Then it happens to me to do a wrong operation, send a crypto to an address of another crypto, but always inside Binance, which is not allowed. Here too, everything is mechanized, it would be enough for the platform to block the operation from the beginning \"operation not permitted\" like any bank in the world does: if you make a mistake, the transfer does not send the money, you find it in your account and nothing serious.Here, however, they easily take the cryptos from your account but they do not arrive. So I call support where they are super kind, they examine the case and then tell me that the operation is wrong. Of course, I also realized, AFTER, that the operation was wrong, but at this point it is a question of recovering the cryptos that by the way moved on the same platform. At that point even more kind than before, he re-examines the case and replies that he understands my pain but \"we are not capable of recovering the cryptos\". Screw you. Without any technical explanation, without making it clear what happened. It was my money and if I operated with them it means that I was trusting them. You can't close with \"we are not capable\" we are sorry but screw you.Where did the cryptos that started but didn't get anywhere go? Did they retain them? But above all: given that these are hyper technological platforms, is it so difficult to block the operation at the beginning instead of letting it go wrong? How many cryptos have disappeared like this? Where did they go?Absolutely avoid \u2026..The id case is 130310503 of 23 october, my true name is sabino ardito. If you can do something to recover cryptos, please do it, also retaining your expensnes, I understand there is a manual work for and a fee for you. But dont make me lose the whole amount. Thanks."

Crypocurrency was created with full access and permission, thus giving everyone a fair chance at making geniune wealth and money. Not by scamming random countries and then pulling out of investments with their 51% attacks and or mass buy-outs and sell orders. I would be supprized if BInance owner was involved with the Luna token and their investment tactics to take your hard yearned money. There are three major tokens to question and everyone knows who they are when you follow the blockchain."

There is not a single free operation, whatever you do you pay, even to deposit money you have to pay (while no forex broker dreams of making you pay on deposits). The simple conversion of currencies has a spread (which is not visible) of 2%. A small commission can be there but 2% is a huge amount for all mechanized operations at 0 cost for them.Then it happens to me to do a wrong operation, send a crypto to an address of another crypto, but always inside Binance, which is not allowed. Here too, everything is mechanized, it would be enough for the platform to block the operation from the beginning \"operation not permitted\" like any bank in the world does: if you make a mistake, the transfer does not send the money, you find it in your account and nothing serious.Here, however, they easily take the cryptos from your account but they do not arrive. So I call support where they are super kind, they examine the case and then tell me that the operation is wrong. Of course, I also realized, AFTER, that the operation was wrong, but at this point it is a question of recovering the cryptos that by the way moved on the same platform. At that point even more kind than before, he re-examines the case and replies that he understands my pain but \"we are not capable of recovering the cryptos\". Screw you. Without any technical explanation, without making it clear what happened. It was my money and if I operated with them it means that I was trusting them. You can't close with \"we are not capable\" we are sorry but screw you.Where did the cryptos that started but didn't get anywhere go? Did they retain them? But above all: given that these are hyper technological platforms, is it so difficult to block the operation at the beginning instead of letting it go wrong? How many cryptos have disappeared like this? Where did they go?Absolutely avoid \u2026..The id case is 130310503 of 23 october, my true name is sabino ardito. If you can do something to recover cryptos, please do it, also retaining your expensnes, I understand there is a manual work for and a fee for you. But dont make me lose the whole amount. Thanks."

Here too, everything is mechanized, it would be enough for the platform to block the operation from the beginning \"operation not permitted\" like any bank in the world does: if you make a mistake, the transfer does not send the money, you find it in your account and nothing serious.Here, however, they easily take the cryptos from your account but they do not arrive. So I call support where they are super kind, they examine the case and then tell me that the operation is wrong. Of course, I also realized, AFTER, that the operation was wrong, but at this point it is a question of recovering the cryptos that by the way moved on the same platform. At that point even more kind than before, he re-examines the case and replies that he understands my pain but \"we are not capable of recovering the cryptos\". Screw you. Without any technical explanation, without making it clear what happened. It was my money and if I operated with them it means that I was trusting them. You can't close with \"we are not capable\" we are sorry but screw you.Where did the cryptos that started but didn't get anywhere go? Did they retain them? But above all: given that these are hyper technological platforms, is it so difficult to block the operation at the beginning instead of letting it go wrong? How many cryptos have disappeared like this? Where did they go?Absolutely avoid \u2026..The id case is 130310503 of 23 october, my true name is sabino ardito. If you can do something to recover cryptos, please do it, also retaining your expensnes, I understand there is a manual work for and a fee for you. But dont make me lose the whole amount. Thanks."

                "review": "They are basically technological scammers. If you want to lose your money, this is the place for you. There is not a single free operation, whatever you do you pay, even to deposit money you have to pay (while no forex broker dreams of making you pay on deposits). The simple conversion of currencies has a spread (which is not visible) of 2%. A small commission can be there but 2% is a huge amount for all mechanized operations at 0 cost for them.Then it happens to me to do a wrong operation, send a crypto to an address of another crypto, but always inside Binance, which is not allowed. Here too, everything is mechanized, it would be enough for the platform to block the operation from the beginning \"operation not permitted\" like any bank in the world does: if you make a mistake, the transfer does not send the money, you find it in your account and nothing serious.Here, however, they easily take the cryptos from your account but they do not arrive. So I call support where they are super kind, they examine the case and then tell me that the operation is wrong. Of course, I also realized, AFTER, that the operation was wrong, but at this point it is a question of recovering the cryptos that by the way moved on the same platform. At that point even more kind than before, he re-examines the case and replies that he understands my pain but \"we are not capable of recovering the cryptos\". Screw you. Without any technical explanation, without making it clear what happened. It was my money and if I operated with them it means that I was trusting them. You can't close with \"we are not capable\" we are sorry but screw you.Where did the cryptos that started but didn't get anywhere go? Did they retain them? But above all: given that these are hyper technological platforms, is it so difficult to block the operation at the beginning instead of letting it go wrong? How many cryptos have disappeared like this? Where did they go?Absolutely avoid \u2026..The id case is 130310503 of 23 october, my true name is sabino ardito. If you can do something to recover cryptos, please do it, also retaining your expensnes, I understand there is a manual work for and a fee for you. But dont make me lose the whole amount. Thanks."

BUT my wife doesnt have a Binance account, but according the scammers she has and they need her ID/Passport to withdraw 1.7BTC from her account...  She will directly ask me, what is this whatsapp group, I dont even have Binance. Also Binance has a statement on their website that they will never contact you via whatsapp or viber. I have reported over 80 scamming Whatsapp groups to both Whatsapp and Binance and almost all of them are taken down within days. If you see something that is too good...., check with Binance chat support first...."

Then on November 1, 2024, he lost consciousness while walking down the street and was diagnosed with a stroke.Yesterday, November 4, 2024, Binance requested a medical certificate and I submitted it.I am currently unable to receive treatment at the hospital because I have no money to pay off my loan interest, etc. due to the 5-month suspension of Binance withdrawals.I have begged and pleaded several times to allow me to receive treatment at the hospital starting November 1st.On November 5, 2024, I heard something shocking from the customer service center and doubted my eyes.Here is the relevant content.Binance cs: Did you get the medical report?Me: I have already submitted itMe: The doctor advised me to go to the hospital quicklyMe: He said that as time goes by, I lose more and more of my nervesBinance cs: There is no stamp. All doctors carry a stampMe: Call the hospital and ask!Me: You call and ask! If my diagnosis is fake, take all my money!Me:  I'm fighting for my health right now and living in hellish pain every day! You crazy bastard! Check all the paperwork! Call the hospital and ask!Me: Are human health issues a joke to you?Binance cs: I have had serious health issues, I know the drill. Medical reports are stampedBinance cs: No MRI or X-rays are done without proper paperworkMe: That must be your country, not this countryMe: Okay, here are all the document numbers. Call them directly and check everythingThe customer service center simply does not care about the user. I submitted a medical certificate, but they did not believe it and told me to call the hospital directly and confirm the document number.I was diagnosed with a stroke and I still see double and my left leg paralysis is getting worse.The doctor said that I need to get treatment as soon as possible to save my nerves...I am not a criminal. I have money, but I can't get treatment at the hospital. I don't have insurance.When I say I have symptoms of oxygen deficiency, dizziness, and severe paralysis, Binance says this:Please wait patiently.I feel like my physical condition is getting worse day by day and my paralysis is getting worse. So I'm just going to have to wait patiently?Then why did binance ask me to submit a medical certificate? Did binance just ask me to submit a hospital certificate because binance cs were bored?If the customer support response is copy and paste, just use a robot."

Purchasing and selling goes fine and without any problems.I believe that some of the reviews here are not a review of Binance. But from people that are got scammed by scammers pretending they are Binance. I get at least once a month an invite into a whatsapp group (and also my wife). BUT my wife doesnt have a Binance account, but according the scammers she has and they need her ID/Passport to withdraw 1.7BTC from her account...  She will directly ask me, what is this whatsapp group, I dont even have Binance. Also Binance has a statement on their website that they will never contact you via whatsapp or viber. I have reported over 80 scamming Whatsapp groups to both Whatsapp and Binance and almost all of them are taken down within days. If you see something that is too good...., check with Binance chat support first...."

To enhance overall user experience, it is essential to focus on reducing wait times, resolving withdrawal problems efficiently, and improving the quality of customer service.",

You just froze my money without my knowledge, no prior email no notification nothing . My 11 bitcoins in USDT has now become 2.4 bitcoins in USDT as I am unable to trade or convert. My account is clean with no open orders, no pending p2p, no earn , no history of buy and sell crypto and no history of fiat deposit ot withdraw . All I did was send my funds from my personal crypto.com account into Binance because I was in Ukraine and the war had come and safety we felt was Binance. I just have so much regrets at this point as life has gotten very very difficult at the moment with children involve. 60 days and no single email or notification from a company I save in and when u lodge a complain about my account you tell me I can go to the police or contact whatever authority. I don\u2019t remember saving my money at the police or authority so it\u2019s normal to have an issue and discuss with you where I save and have my assets. Free my USDT"

Then on November 1, 2024, he lost consciousness while walking down the street and was diagnosed with a stroke.Yesterday, November 4, 2024, Binance requested a medical certificate and I submitted it.I am currently unable to receive treatment at the hospital because I have no money to pay off my loan interest, etc. due to the 5-month suspension of Binance withdrawals.I have begged and pleaded several times to allow me to receive treatment at the hospital starting November 1st.On November 5, 2024, I heard something shocking from the customer service center and doubted my eyes.Here is the relevant content.Binance cs: Did you get the medical report?Me: I have already submitted itMe: The doctor advised me to go to the hospital quicklyMe: He said that as time goes by, I lose more and more of my nervesBinance cs: There is no stamp. All doctors carry a stampMe: Call the hospital and ask!Me: You call and ask! If my diagnosis is fake, take all my money!Me:  I'm fighting for my health right now and living in hellish pain every day! You crazy bastard! Check all the paperwork! Call the hospital and ask!Me: Are human health issues a joke to you?Binance cs: I have had serious health issues, I know the drill. Medical reports are stampedBinance cs: No MRI or X-rays are done without proper paperworkMe: That must be your country, not this countryMe: Okay, here are all the document numbers. Call them directly and check everythingThe customer service center simply does not care about the user. I submitted a medical certificate, but they did not believe it and told me to call the hospital directly and confirm the document number.I was diagnosed with a stroke and I still see double and my left leg paralysis is getting worse.The doctor said that I need to get treatment as soon as possible to save my nerves...I am not a criminal. I have money, but I can't get treatment at the hospital. I don't have insurance.When I say I have symptoms of oxygen deficiency, dizziness, and severe paralysis, Binance says this:Please wait patiently.I feel like my physical condition is getting worse day by day and my paralysis is getting worse. So I'm just going to have to wait patiently?Then why did binance ask me to submit a medical certificate? Did binance just ask me to submit a hospital certificate because binance cs were bored?If the customer support response is copy and paste, just use a robot."

Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it.

You just froze my money without my knowledge, no prior email no notification nothing . My 11 bitcoins in USDT has now become 2.4 bitcoins in USDT as I am unable to trade or convert. My account is clean with no open orders, no pending p2p, no earn , no history of buy and sell crypto and no history of fiat deposit ot withdraw . All I did was send my funds from my personal crypto.com account into Binance because I was in Ukraine and the war had come and safety we felt was Binance. I just have so much regrets at this point as life has gotten very very difficult at the moment with children involve. 60 days and no single email or notification from a company I save in and when u lodge a complain about my account you tell me I can go to the police or contact whatever authority. I don\u2019t remember saving my money at the police or authority so it\u2019s normal to have an issue and discuss with you where I save and have my assets. Free my USDT"

Not by scamming random countries and then pulling out of investments with their 51% attacks and or mass buy-outs and sell orders. I would be supprized if BInance owner was involved with the Luna token and their investment tactics to take your hard yearned money.

Even it is a platform of 23million users their trustpilot review say how much user frustrated about their system. I'm one of them. If binance can stop or modify locking account such as facial verification every 24hour or everytime network change , I will appreciate it.

My account is clean with no open orders, no pending p2p, no earn , no history of buy and sell crypto and no history of fiat deposit ot withdraw . All I did was send my funds from my personal crypto.com account into Binance because I was in Ukraine and the war had come and safety we felt was Binance. I just have so much regrets at this point as life has gotten very very difficult at the moment with children involve. 60 days and no single email or notification from a company I save in and when u lodge a complain about my account you tell me I can go to the police or contact whatever authority. I don\u2019t remember saving my money at the police or authority so it\u2019s normal to have an issue and discuss with you where I save and have my assets. Free my USDT"

                "review": "Two weeks ago, I used Binance's P2P service and was connected with an official seller named Smart OTC. They offered the service to deliver USDC after receiving 25.000,-Euros via SEPA transfer. The exchange rate of 0.93 euros per USDC seemed reasonable.However, I encountered several issues during the process I followed intensively . The verification procedures were extensive, including personally written and signed statements confirming my legal intentions dealing with crypto currencies etc. accompanied by unusual selfies holding the statements. This made me feel uncomfortable and a little concerned about the procedure. But then the real nightmare started. The seller did not acknowledge receiving my 25,000 euro transfer, even after I provided screenshots of my bank account showing the transaction. They then attempted to persuade me to cancel the order and place a new one with a significantly less favorable exchange rate.Given these circumstances, I decided to seek assistance from Binance's official support service.. To summarize the unprofessional and unsupportive events, here are some details. Despite the time constraints and even at night, I was asked to provide official bank statements, screenshots of my bank account, and a live video of accessing my banking app to show the transaction to ATC Finance UAB, the bank account mentioned by Smart OTC. Additionally, the seller attempted to persuade me to cancel the initial order,to opt for a new one with a significantly worse exchange rate and at the same time giving an official confirmation at the Binance platform that I did not pay or I had been refunded as a a reason for cancellation of the first order. During the appeal process, Binance Support suggested a reasonable solution by offering a refund. However, the seller introduced a new demand, requesting a tracking ID for my SEPA transaction. After consulting with my bank, Deutsche Bank, and conducting online research, I discovered that a tracking ID does not exist for SEPA transactions. Despite providing all this information, Binance Support terminated my appeal.Regrettably, the seller has not issued a refund or performed the currency exchange. Furthermore, they made another attempt to convince me to accept an exchange rate of 1.29 Euro/USDC. Based on these experiences, I have concluded that Smart OTC is engaging in fraudulent activities. Additionally, Binance Support appears to be siding with these fraudulent actions, which is disappointing and does not align with the concept of providing genuine support.Dr. Gerd K."

They always say expedite high priority.I have heard the words Expedite and highpririty 26 times from Binance in 5 months.The doctor said I can no longer use my left leg because of Binance's lies.I lost golden time for operation.However, I still cannot receive treatment because I do not have the money to pay the hospital bill.Please everyone share my review.Please share this so that no more victims like me appear.I can't move my body, so my friend is posting the review for me. I talk and my friend types it.Binance is a robber without a knife."

You just froze my money without my knowledge, no prior email no notification nothing . My 11 bitcoins in USDT has now become 2.4 bitcoins in USDT as I am unable to trade or convert. My account is clean with no open orders, no pending p2p, no earn , no history of buy and sell crypto and no history of fiat deposit ot withdraw . All I did was send my funds from my personal crypto.com account into Binance because I was in Ukraine and the war had come and safety we felt was Binance. I just have so much regrets at this point as life has gotten very very difficult at the moment with children involve. 60 days and no single email or notification from a company I save in and when u lodge a complain about my account you tell me I can go to the police or contact whatever authority. I don\u2019t remember saving my money at the police or authority so it\u2019s normal to have an issue and discuss with you where I save and have my assets. Free my USDT"

I would be supprized if BInance owner was involved with the Luna token and their investment tactics to take your hard yearned money.

They always say expedite high priority.I have heard the words Expedite and highpririty 26 times from Binance in 5 months.The doctor said I can no longer use my left leg because of Binance's lies.I lost golden time for operation.However, I still cannot receive treatment because I do not have the money to pay the hospital bill.Please everyone share my review.Please share this so that no more victims like me appear.I can't move my body, so my friend is posting the review for me.

Since establishing a company is so simple that it can be said to be completed with just one sheet of paper, and corporate tax is as cheap as in other developed countries, many multinational companies register their offices here in minimal corporate form and move a significant portion of their company funds to avoid the heavy taxes that would be imposed if they were in their home countries.Can you trust them and trade with Binance?I was suspended from Binance for 5 months without any reason, and now I have been diagnosed with a stroke and my left leg is completely paralyzed due to Binance's late action.They are murderers, not just with knives. My life is not more important than Binance's review time. My request for surgery is nothing more than a copy and paste of Binance's customer service.
