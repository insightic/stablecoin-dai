The support stopped responding to my emails a month ago. Looks like think goes bad for them, if they scam people in so dumb way. I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t make a larger deposit.

This is just crazy, they pretend to be a great exchange blablabla but the support is simply rude, the rules just changed not even giving a chance to adapt. Really can't recommend.

However, the prevalence of negative reviews, with an average rating of 2.2, points to widespread user dissatisfaction, particularly due to technical problems and poor customer service experiences. Critical issues such as account access barriers and subpar interface performance are major sources of frustration for users, overshadowing the app's positive aspects. For improvement, the app developers should prioritize enhancing the user interface, streamlining account access processes, and bolstering customer support to address the concerns and potentially improve overall user satisfaction.",

I don't believe I'll get my money back anymore. It's an impudence like I've never experienced on a crypto exchange. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!"

Technological infrastructure is being strengthened through the integration of Tether and other platforms, highlighting a push towards greater usability and mainstream acceptance.

Only had 90\u20ac left! Can you believe it? Freaking 80% just vanished into thin air!Before I hit that \"swap\" button, got this pop-up warning about high fees, but lol, I never thought they'd be this outrageous. Bitfinex hit me with fees so high, they practically held me up at gunpoint. It's like highway robbery, but in the crypto world!And don't even get me started on their customer service \u2013 or lack thereof! I hit 'em up, looking for some answers, and all I got was a bunch of vague, useless replies. Like, seriously? Zero transparency, zero help, just a big fat \"sucks to be you\" vibe.As if that's not bad enough, trying to find info on their fees is like playing detective. Bitfinex hides that stuff better than buried treasure! They're straight-up tricking users, making our hard-earned cash vanish faster than you can say \"crypto scam.\"Listen up, peeps, learn from my mistake. Steer clear of Bitfinex unless you're cool with getting fleeced. This platform's a dumpster fire, a total train wreck for anyone dabbling in crypto. Save yourself the headache \u2013 look elsewhere, ofc!"

Only had 90\u20ac left! Can you believe it? Freaking 80% just vanished into thin air!Before I hit that \"swap\" button, got this pop-up warning about high fees, but lol, I never thought they'd be this outrageous. Bitfinex hit me with fees so high, they practically held me up at gunpoint. It's like highway robbery, but in the crypto world!And don't even get me started on their customer service \u2013 or lack thereof! I hit 'em up, looking for some answers, and all I got was a bunch of vague, useless replies. Like, seriously? Zero transparency, zero help, just a big fat \"sucks to be you\" vibe.As if that's not bad enough, trying to find info on their fees is like playing detective. Bitfinex hides that stuff better than buried treasure! They're straight-up tricking users, making our hard-earned cash vanish faster than you can say \"crypto scam.\"Listen up, peeps, learn from my mistake. Steer clear of Bitfinex unless you're cool with getting fleeced. This platform's a dumpster fire, a total train wreck for anyone dabbling in crypto. Save yourself the headache \u2013 look elsewhere, ofc!"

Only had 90\u20ac left! Can you believe it? Freaking 80% just vanished into thin air!Before I hit that \"swap\" button, got this pop-up warning about high fees, but lol, I never thought they'd be this outrageous. Bitfinex hit me with fees so high, they practically held me up at gunpoint. It's like highway robbery, but in the crypto world!And don't even get me started on their customer service \u2013 or lack thereof! I hit 'em up, looking for some answers, and all I got was a bunch of vague, useless replies. Like, seriously? Zero transparency, zero help, just a big fat \"sucks to be you\" vibe.As if that's not bad enough, trying to find info on their fees is like playing detective. Bitfinex hides that stuff better than buried treasure! They're straight-up tricking users, making our hard-earned cash vanish faster than you can say \"crypto scam.\"Listen up, peeps, learn from my mistake. Steer clear of Bitfinex unless you're cool with getting fleeced. This platform's a dumpster fire, a total train wreck for anyone dabbling in crypto. Save yourself the headache \u2013 look elsewhere, ofc!"

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

I don't believe I'll get my money back anymore. It's an impudence like I've never experienced on a crypto exchange. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!"

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Contacted support in panic and luckily they said they would take on the recovery. Albeit for an excessive fee.So I organised the $735 USDT which they immediately withdrew from my account.Fast forward 3 months and one week on, they have:1. Failed to perform any action2. Only reply with what seems like AI generated responses with fake compassion and empathy3. Failed to escalate the matter to senior management4. Repeatedly lied that they were working on it5. Now do not even reply to support emails.All the while, 3 Eth in the same manner was sent to HTX exchange, they recovered my ETH on the same day for ZERO fee.This platform is an absolute horror story, bordering scam when it comes to support. Their live chat support is nothing but an AI bot which doesn't recognise questions outside of its knowledge centre subjects and is totally useless.You'll have the same support staff who initially replied to my emails but when things get sticky, they don't even sign off with their names but with just \"Bitfinex Support\". Mind you, I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with over 1bn in trading volume over the years. They do not give a damm however. I have so much resentment towards them, if you're ever considering to use this scammy exchange I would think twice and choose more support friendly exchanges like HTX or Binance.If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.I am absolutely at my wits-end and because they are unregulated, there's no official body you can make a complaints towards. Abandon this exchange at all costs as I will be moving all my digital assets off this platform. Because when tether goes down so will this platform with all your assets and I 100% assure you with absolute confidence there will be zero chances of recovering any assets  when they go under.Absolutely despicable and disgusting behaviour they have displayed to date."

Initially, customer support was praised for its responsiveness and effectiveness, but recent reviews highlight unresponsiveness and unresolved issues, indicating a deterioration in service quality. Common concerns include poor customer service, false advertising, unfulfilled promises, slow response times, app bugs, and a lack of transparency. Despite some positive feedback on security measures and occasional good customer support, these are overshadowed by the prevalent negative experiences. To improve, the company should focus on enhancing customer support responsiveness, addressing technical issues, ensuring transparency, and fulfilling advertised promises.",

The conversations identified roadblocks for public-private partnerships (PPPs), which often arise from differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities. Building mutual trust is essential, as it can either accelerate or hinder collaboration efforts. For potential improvement or further investigation, there is a need to address these regulatory and operational challenges to enhance collaboration and integration between digital and traditional financial systems.",

Despite these negative aspects, there is some praise for reliability and trustworthiness, though these are overshadowed by the negative experiences. The lack of additional reviews makes it difficult to gauge overall user satisfaction, as the average rating is based on a single 5-star review. To improve, the company should focus on enhancing customer support responsiveness, increasing transparency in their operations, and addressing any concerns about hidden charges or unsustainable practices.",

I\u2019ve contacted support numerous times but only receive automated responses or requests for more documents. There is no clear explanation for the freeze, and my funds remain inaccessible. Bitfinex's lack of communication and transparency is unacceptable. Until this is resolved, I cannot recommend this platform to anyone. Use with caution!"
