Is there anyone from the support team who is able to look into my ticket? The ticket number is 09189652. It would help me a lot if someone is able to look into this. On one side because I don't have access to my account at this point, but on the other hand because I see some serious risks at this point. Thanks in advance."

It's been almost 2 weeks.I never got the amount from any of the buyers since. I appeal with uploading the video every single time. But all the five times the appeal is cancelled. What do I need to do to return my money back already? Can't you just cancel or close the deal by yourself? The buyer doesn't even read or login since. Definitely not a behaviour of a person, who sent his money. UPDIT WAS CANCELLED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!WITH NO ASKING FOR ANYTHING, NO CHECKING THE PROOF, NO ADDITIONAL \"PLEASE SHOW US MORE PROOF\". NO. JUST CANCELLED. 6TH DAMN TIME. OMG. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

                "review": "Bybit is hands down the most untrustworthy exchange I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I am in Taiwan. My credit card name is in English. My ID (which was used for the KYC) is in Chinese. They won't let you enter your name in Chinese when adding the card. Thus when it goes to process the transaction it fails because the name on the ID and the card don't match. KYC is supposed to be used to prevent money laundering. This purchase is for less than $100 US. I am sure money launderers are making $100 deposits (/sarc) . There should be a threshhold above a certain amount  where KYC has to be used."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever.

BYSCAM have emailed me twice in the last 3/4 months to say that the case had been resolved which is complete horse excrement.

I provided the Txid and a video of transfer to the bybit support team. Now it has been over 3 months and I keep receiving the same generic email of providing the TXID which I sent them multiple times. I really do not know what else is required and I am waiting since 3 months now and I do see any funds that has been transferred back!"

                "review": "This exchange and it's support team seems to think ERC20 and Ethereum Mainnet are synonymous. They are not. There are many chains that support ERC20 tokens. On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

If you're looking for a guaranteed way to get scammed, look no further.My recent experience with Bybit has been a nightmare from start to finish. I deposited a significant amount of crypto into my account, expecting to use it for trading opportunities. Little did I know, that deposit would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.Despite reaching out to Bybit's supposed \"customer support\" multiple times, I have yet to receive a single response. It's crystal clear that they have no intention of helping their customers or addressing their concerns. They take your money and run, leaving you high and dry with no recourse.Dealing with Bybit is not just a risk, it's practically a guarantee that you'll be scammed. They lure you in with promises of easy trading and quick profits, but the reality is far from it. They're nothing but a bunch of crooks running a shady operation.Save yourself the headache and avoid Bybit like the plague. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later. There are plenty of reputable exchanges out there that actually value their customers and prioritize their needs. Bybit is not one of them. Stay far, far away.Case ID: 09412236"

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

BYSCAM unlocked the sellers USDT despite receiving all the evidence of the scam. The seller has then went on to try to scam others but unfortunately for them the respective buyers became aware of the intentions. Woukdnt be suorised if the seller is an employee of BYSCAM as they have been able to scam and recover funds awhile the account has been restricted.I have send 10+ emails to BYSCAM with all the information relating to the case and the evidence of the scam. BYSCAM have emailed me twice in the last 3/4 months to say that the case had been resolved which is complete horse excrement. It would seem that Bybit is bend on destruction of their brand and to steal as much funds as possible from its customers.Until Bybit sort their stuff out PLEASE PLEASE get your money of the platform and inform everyone who may be effected by their dishonesty.BYBIT = THEIVES"

On Bybit's deposit page, they list ERC20 as a \"Chain\" you can deposit to, which is completely ambiguous because many chains support ERC20. Once you deposit your funds to a chain that supports ERC20 (In my case Base chain), they do not show up, because the only supported chain is actually Ethereum Mainnet, and the support team take no accountability. This is extremely poor...I spent 3 days arguing with support about whether the name of Ethereum Mainnet is ERC20 or not. You need to skill your support team up - they are completely incapable...To add a cherry on top, they say it will take 7 more working days to send the funds back - but in the meantime they completely closed my support ticket, so I had to open a new one.Avoid this exchange."

I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

Despite multiple attempts to contact customer support through email, social media, and their support channels, I have received no response. This delay is causing significant financial stress. I expected better support from a platform with such a high trust rating. Please address this issue as soon as possible.Thank you, Bybit Customer Service Team, for resolving my previous P2P appeal promptly after I reached out on various platforms. However, I have another order currently under appeal that has been pending for a long time (Order ID: 1781339545354534912, Amount: 36.90 EUR).

I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

Despite reaching out on multiple platforms, my P2P appeal remains unresolved.Details:- Order ID: 1781339545354534912- Amount: 36.90 EUR- Total USDT: 40.1087- Reason for Appeal: My order was canceled even though I have made the payment.Why do I need to constantly bombard Bybit on every possible platform for them to do their job? It is disgraceful to call yourself a crypto exchange when your support is non-existent. Taking users' money to inflate trading volumes and then failing to provide proper support is a disgrace.Furthermore, I am appalled that CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which are considered reputable rating agencies, have given Bybit a perfect 10/10 rating. My trust in these platforms is severely undermined. How can an exchange in 2024 have a trust score of 10/10 when its support operates at 0?This level of service is unacceptable and a black mark on the reputation of both Bybit and the rating agencies that endorse them.Bybit, you need to step up and resolve this issue immediately."

I passed KYC with relavent documents then they increase my level. Once I passed the KYC. I start trading, I am sending my Kaspa Coins directly from pool, I made so much withdrawals to my Kraken account and vice versa. Made some USDT payments. I think main thing here , I use my own account to transfer or withdraw, So no red flag there. I suggest that use Kraken to receive and send your USDT account in your name then transfer to bybit account, because all accounts under my name, not friends or someone etc. So, there is no red flag situation here. If you want to buy any coins use big exchanges and then transfer from there or withdraw there. Actually, I withdraw fiat to my bank account on bybit and no problem whatsoever. And, they are fairly large amounts. I do not know whats happening but this is my experience and still trading there."

My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Please help for the love of God all my money and my family's money are all in my bybit account and it's so bad to feel like all my funds are frozen just because of $200. They said it would be resolved within 8 days but it still continues. At only 22 years old, I've placed all my hopes and my family's future in Bybit.I'm 22 years old. My father is retired and I deposited my father's money into my Bybit account. I worked all my life and put all my money into my Bybit account. Both my family's money and all my money are in my bybit account. Because I had full confidence in bybit. I cannot support my household because all my money is tied to Bybit.Case ID: 10006306 andUID: 75419275"

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Bybit stated that I needed to submit some documents for KYC verification. They assured me that they would respond within 48 hours, but it has now been more than 10 days and I have not received any response. During this time, I have reached out to their support multiple times, but there has been complete radio silence. My assets are essentially stuck, and I have no way of accessing them. This experience has been incredibly frustrating and stressful. I cannot trust a platform that handles issues in such an unprofessional manner.

                "review": "Case ID: 09810204Bybit UID: 121119390I recently contacted Bybit's support team to relinquish my status as a P2P Merchant and to release my frozen funds amounting to 1000 USD. Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.Despite clearly outlining my request, I did not receive any response from the support team. To make matters worse, my case was prematurely marked as \"solved\" without any resolution. My funds remain frozen, and my status as a P2P Merchant has not been changed.What is particularly concerning is that my case has been neglected for over a week without any acknowledgment or action. This prolonged lack of communication and failure to address my issue is unacceptable. As a result, I am compelled to give Bybit a 1-star rating due to the poor handling of my case. It is crucial for a platform to have responsive and effective customer support, and Bybit has fallen short in this regard.I hope that Bybit takes this feedback seriously and improves their support services to prevent such issues in the future!!!!UPDATE: Bybit has responded to me and was able to solve my issue. Although it took some time for the problem to be resolved, it was ultimately fixed accurately and satisfactorily. As a result, I will be increasing my rating."

After the first deposit, that was smooth, I decided to move my money to Bybit exchange. Unfortunately I am the one like many others, who's deposit is flagged for many days with no contact with support, any explanation or apology. I have done two times deposit 10000 Euro each. After more than a week I have the only one case opened that is under review. The second 10000 Euro deposit looks like is floating in space. In my opinion does not matter how good Bybit is, if my hard earned money are kept with no time limits. Personally I do not give up with Bybit and I will wait for the end of my case. For sure I will not deposit more money as long as my trust is ruined.Tip for Bybit's representativesUAB Onlychain Fintech Limited is responsible for verifications. If they can not make it in declared 48 h, deposits should be automatically rejected and money should be returned or deposit should be bypassed and transferred to account. The issues that are caused by UAB Onlychain Fintech are destroying the whole reputation of Bybit and all purnished efforts of creating good exchange website are lost.With greetingsMarta Rz."

I sent all the videos requested the buyer on the other hand did not send any proof of payment. However, after two the buyer finally accepted that he did not make the payment and the bank had also placed a freeze on his bank account. he has now asked the appeal officer to cancel the trade and return my coins. I have not heard from the appeal for two weeks now. I submitted a case No: 10275617to my utter dismay, this case was closed without ever looking into the case.

In most polite way, I asked bank provider and company responsible for verification for returning my founds - of course I did not receive any answer. I see only \"copy/past\" messages. As I client I feel that I have no right to ask about anything, no right to be ensured that everything is ok, that my money are save, that after verification I will be able to withdraw assets and I will not have to experience delays, that documents that I will send are save and how can I protect documents from any risk. Bybit team, I do not see any way to contact with You. I am forced to blindly follow the windows that appear on screen, I feel like I have no rights as a customer.Dear Bybit Team, on the other side are real people, who as a Your customers deserves more than a bot or copy/past messages.I am tired and I will have to accept psychological blackmail that I am experiencing. It is very upsetting that I can expect no attention and any real answer.With regardsMarta Rz."

Potential areas for further investigation include deeper exploration of stablecoins' role in the market and the long-term impacts of Bitcoin halving on various stakeholders.",

If not for Nigeria banning binance p2p, why would I use bybit in the first place.A buyer send money using different accounts name from registered account name with bybit and I refund the money, the buyer report as scam and bybit without investigation or checking our conversation restrict my account, I message the support with p2p chat and all screenshot of the transfer but no response. The chat with support is not working as well. I miss binance. Here is my UID: 64027019Order number: 1804157310048157696The order is cancelled but my account is restricted(Update) The live chat is also working now wish will make conversation much easier and My restriction as been lifted also but I will love if the buyer that falsely reported me get a penalty because I even message the buyer immediately after I place order that he should use his real account to send the money but he claim that I was paid by bot which is a big lie. After I refund him, he also claim that it will take 5to7 days for him to receive the alert which is also a big lie."

The chat with support is not working as well. I miss binance. Here is my UID: 64027019Order number: 1804157310048157696The order is cancelled but my account is restricted(Update) The live chat is also working now wish will make conversation much easier and My restriction as been lifted also but I will love if the buyer that falsely reported me get a penalty because I even message the buyer immediately after I place order that he should use his real account to send the money but he claim that I was paid by bot which is a big lie. After I refund him, he also claim that it will take 5to7 days for him to receive the alert which is also a big lie."

They don\u2019t ask anything whatsoever. And to make it even worse the refund takes 7 to 14 days to be refunded? How is this even possible? How does it take it so long first to deny a deposit, second to be refunded and third that there is no way of contacting them directly.  This is such a bad and poor customer service. I need my money and now I am obligated to wait more than 3 weeks counting the 5 days that already have past to see my money back? It\u2019s unbelievable."

The chat with support is not working as well. I miss binance. Here is my UID: 64027019Order number: 1804157310048157696The order is cancelled but my account is restricted(Update) The live chat is also working now wish will make conversation much easier and My restriction as been lifted also but I will love if the buyer that falsely reported me get a penalty because I even message the buyer immediately after I place order that he should use his real account to send the money but he claim that I was paid by bot which is a big lie. After I refund him, he also claim that it will take 5to7 days for him to receive the alert which is also a big lie."

Finally, at around 96 hours I receieved the answer that my documents proving the income were insufficient. I submitted more documents, and the \"new\" term of 48 hours is almost elapsed, even though via instagram they guaranteed they would have sped up.Now I believe the are stealing the money.I find KYC procedures tedious, but I understand they must observe them by law.

Finally, at around 96 hours I receieved the answer that my documents proving the income were insufficient. I submitted more documents, and the \"new\" term of 48 hours is almost elapsed, even though via instagram they guaranteed they would have sped up.Now I believe the are stealing the money.I find KYC procedures tedious, but I understand they must observe them by law. Even accepting this, the correct way should have been to REJECT MY DEPOSIT - ASK FOR DOCUMENTS - THEN ALLOW FOR THE MONEY TO BE DEPOSITED. Insted they took my money, then they froze it arbitrarily."

One time they froze my money asking for documents proving the income and my ID document (which they already had).Then I made some more transfers.Last Friday I made a big 10.000$ transfer. The money arrived on bybit, then I bought usdt with it.After that, they blocked my usdt asking again for the same info they already had.I immediately submitted the documents and waited the 48hours they delcared were needed for the review.After 80 hours nothing had happened, and they were UNREACHABLE via customer support.I found a good soul on instagram who answered me and promised they would have expedited the procedure. Finally, at around 96 hours I receieved the answer that my documents proving the income were insufficient. I submitted more documents, and the \"new\" term of 48 hours is almost elapsed, even though via instagram they guaranteed they would have sped up.Finally at total of 136 HOURS (not promised 48) I got my money unblocked.The correct way should have been to REJECT MY DEPOSIT - ASK FOR DOCUMENTS - THEN ALLOW FOR THE MONEY TO BE DEPOSITED. Instead they took my money, then they froze it arbitrarily.ALSO: I have a p2p order which was fraudulent. The appeal was to no avail and AS USUAL, NO CUSTOMER SEVICE.

This has caused a restriction on my account from both p2p and withdrawal, I have filed a dispute on the order on Sunday 7th July and an email came in later Sunday evening saying a resolution is already reached and my appeal closed. They said my frozen assets will be released soon but nothing yet, I\u2019m still restricted from withdrawal and p2p.  Pls I need help with this right now.

You file dispute and you just see your dispute being cancelled , meanwhile the buyer goes completely quite and despite the moderator seeing that you\u2019re the only one begging and telling them you were not paid they still cancel and exit chat . I have my money stucked in 2 different trades now . Reached out to email support over a week ago , ticket created but no actual response . They don\u2019t respond on social media either . Worst customer service and support .Can\u2019t even upload video of proof while in appeal because it won\u2019t upload , Then how are you meant to submit proof ? I am not sure this site would not be top site in the new few years , it just sucks compared to binance .Look into my order and get my coined that was locked released because the buyers did not pay.Infact one of the orders the buyer clearly stated he did not pay , I did an appeal and what did the moderator do ??? Cancel appeal .What a big joke .Transaction order ID 1811533506964533248Transaction order ID 1807353960805875712My UID 150207814Apeal and release my coin for both trades .Anybody could just come to the site , mark trade as paid and delete the app on their phone while the other party has to suffer .

My issues with order disputes, related to order numbers 1810413416543465472, 1809984123983331328, and 1809962479753895936, remain unresolved for days.My assets have been frozen for an extended period, and the users involved are unresponsive. The lack of support and guidance from the Bybit team has made an already frustrating situation even more distressing.I urgently request that my matter be highlighted and resolved as soon as possible. I request immediate attention to unfreeze my assets and assist me in resolving these order disputes.The unavailability of live agents for chat and the inability to resolve my issues promptly have led to a frustrating experience. I hope Bybit improves its support system to assist users more effectively.Until then, I would caution users to be aware of the potential difficulties in resolving issues with this platform.Please help me resolve this matter urgently.My UID: 159061149"

After I provided all necessary docs and proofs, support said that I can withdraw back my funds, BUT there is no withdraw button or link (support thinks that they resolved the issue, without technically doing so). After that, support just ignores me and my funds are still in pending assets frozen without any possibility to do something with it. So, If you want your deposit to be frozen without any reason and support completely ignoring you, then this exchange is for you.Hopefully bybit representative will see it and resolve this issue.

I request immediate attention to unfreeze my assets and assist me in resolving these order disputes.The unavailability of live agents for chat and the inability to resolve my issues promptly have led to a frustrating experience.

After I provided all necessary docs and proofs, support said that I can withdraw back my funds, BUT there is no withdraw button or link (support thinks that they resolved the issue, without technically doing so). After that, support just ignores me and my funds are still in pending assets frozen without any possibility to do something with it.

I need the restriction on my account lifted so I can continue with my trades.UID - 148879762Case Number - #10776147Order ID - 1808590085422477312"

My issues with order disputes, related to order numbers 1810413416543465472, 1809984123983331328, and 1809962479753895936, remain unresolved for days.My assets have been frozen for an extended period, and the users involved are unresponsive. The lack of support and guidance from the Bybit team has made an already frustrating situation even more distressing.I urgently request that my matter be highlighted and resolved as soon as possible. I request immediate attention to unfreeze my assets and assist me in resolving these order disputes.The unavailability of live agents for chat and the inability to resolve my issues promptly have led to a frustrating experience. I hope Bybit improves its support system to assist users more effectively.Until then, I would caution users to be aware of the potential difficulties in resolving issues with this platform.Please help me resolve this matter urgently.My UID: 159061149"

After I provided all necessary docs and proofs, support said that I can withdraw back my funds, BUT there is no withdraw button or link (support thinks that they resolved the issue, without technically doing so). After that, support just ignores me and my funds are still in pending assets frozen without any possibility to do something with it. So, If you want your deposit to be frozen without any reason and support completely ignoring you, then this exchange is for you.Hopefully bybit representative will see it and resolve this issue.

When I tried to withdraw the fiat funds (a 3 figure \u20ac amount) Bybit suddenly required KYC Lv. 2 verification to process the request. This, bybit had never done before. Up to now, Lv1 clearance (which is my level) was all that's required to retrieve such an amount. Since the helpdesk could not be reached in order to resolve the issue, a recent bank statement with my name (spelled correctly) and my address (up to date, correct, registered with bybit) was submitted to obtain the dubious Lv. 2 clearance to make a fiat withdrawal possible. Merely seconds after uploading the document, it was rejected out of hand, WRONGLY claiming it had been falsified and my account was blocked. ....laughable!Helpdesk has of course not responded so far... and I am wondering now, if bybit has become a scam.UID 164203224"

When I tried to withdraw the fiat funds (a 3 figure \u20ac amount) Bybit suddenly required KYC Lv. 2 verification to process the request. This, bybit had never done before. Up to now, Lv1 clearance (which is my level) was all that's required to retrieve such an amount. Since the helpdesk could not be reached in order to resolve the issue, a recent bank statement with my name (spelled correctly) and my address (up to date, correct, registered with bybit) was submitted to obtain the dubious Lv. 2 clearance to make a fiat withdrawal possible. Merely seconds after uploading the document, it was rejected out of hand, WRONGLY claiming it had been falsified and my account was blocked. ....laughable!Helpdesk has of course not responded so far... and I am wondering now, if bybit has become a scam.UID 164203224"

There is no way to talk to a real person from technical support. It feels like the company doesn't care about its customers at all.Terrible experience!I hope that my problem will be solved soon and I will switch to another platform."

Up to now, Lv1 clearance (which is my level) was all that's required to retrieve such an amount. Since the helpdesk could not be reached in order to resolve the issue, a recent bank statement with my name (spelled correctly) and my address (up to date, correct, registered with bybit) was submitted to obtain the dubious Lv. 2 clearance to make a fiat withdrawal possible. Merely seconds after uploading the document, it was rejected out of hand, WRONGLY claiming it had been falsified and my account was blocked. ....laughable!Helpdesk has of course not responded so far... and I am wondering now, if bybit has become a scam.UID 164203224"

Support is not responding, and it feels like they want to keep my money.Please, if you see this message and you're with Bybit support, let's find a solution.

I've been patient, but the constant delays and lack of action are unacceptable. I demand a clear explanation for the delay and an immediate update on when I can expect my refund. I've wasted enough time waiting for your team to resolve this issue. I expect a prompt response and resolution, or I'll be forced to take further action.

My verification level is 2.I was really happy with bybit until my fiat deposit of 1100\u20ac has been blocked. I was asked to submit proof of funds and i have provided all the necessary documents. I was told to wait up to 48 hours. But even after one week my documents have not been processed and my funds are still blocked. Can you please help me to get them back or at least to release.

La funzione di prelievo \u00e8 stata ingiustamente limitata a causa di presunte \"attivit\u00e0 sospette\", nonostante io non abbia fatto nulla di sbagliato. Il sistema ha rilevato alcune transazioni sospette, ma queste non sono state effettuate da me. Ho gi\u00e0 inviato tutti i documenti richiesti e ho provato pi\u00f9 volte a contattare l'assistenza clienti, ma non ho ricevuto alcuna risoluzione n\u00e9 un aiuto concreto.Ho fondi significativi bloccati nel mio account, e Bybit mi sta impedendo di accedervi. Questo \u00e8 completamente inaccettabile. Se questo problema non verr\u00e0 risolto immediatamente, sar\u00f2 costretto a prendere ulteriori provvedimenti, e consiglier\u00f2 ad altri di evitare l'utilizzo di Bybit, dato che la piattaforma non tutela la sicurezza e l'accessibilit\u00e0 dei fondi degli utenti.Bybit, vi invito a prendere seriamente la mia situazione e a permettermi di prelevare i miei soldi. Tenere in ostaggio i miei fondi \u00e8 non solo poco etico, ma anche dannoso per la vostra reputazione. Risolvete questo problema immediatamente!I am deeply disappointed with Bybit's handling of my account. My withdrawal function has been unjustly restricted due to alleged \"suspicious activities,\" despite the fact that I have done nothing wrong. The system detected some suspicious transactions, but these were not conducted by me. I have already submitted all the required documents and have repeatedly tried to contact customer support, but there has been no resolution or meaningful assistance provided.I have significant funds sitting in my account, and Bybit is preventing me from accessing them. This is completely unacceptable. If this issue is not resolved immediately, I will be forced to take further action, and I will advise others to avoid using Bybit, as it clearly does not prioritize the security and accessibility of its users' funds.Bybit, I urge you to take my situation seriously and allow me to withdraw my money. Holding my funds hostage is not only unethical but damaging to your platform\u2019s reputation. Resolve this issue now!"

Despite a third-party security examination, these negative sentiments persist, suggesting that the examination did not alleviate user concerns. Positive feedback is notably absent in the recent reviews, indicating a potential decline in customer satisfaction. To improve, the service should address transparency issues, enhance the reliability of its trading and withdrawal processes, and ensure that security measures are effectively communicated and trusted by users.",

This was my first trading platform in the world of cryptocurrency, and I sincerely hoped for a positive experience. I registered through a referral link, completed full verification using my passport and biometric data, funded my account, and started participating in various newcomer promotions. However, things quickly went downhill.After several months, I was denied the bonuses I had expected. I was accused of allegedly creating duplicate accounts and engaging in fraudulent activities, which is absolutely untrue. My registration was my first and only one, and I used the platform solely for legitimate trading and to meet the requirements of the promotions. Moreover, I lost over $100 in trading and could not have gained any of the benefits they claimed.Reaching out to customer support was fruitless. For months, I received the same generic responses, pointing to vague \"secret\" rules, but they never explained clearly where and how I had supposedly violated them. Even when I provided evidence to defend myself, they continued to insist that their system detected suspicious activity, even though I was simply using the exchange as intended. While access to my account and withdrawals remained intact, this does not change the fact that I was wrongfully accused and stripped of the bonuses I worked hard to earn.Bybit needs to seriously improve their customer support system, make their investigations transparent, and ensure fairness. It\u2019s hard to trust an exchange that can't explain its decisions and ignores genuine user concerns.I cannot recommend this platform to beginners or anyone who values fair treatment."

It is actually criminal for bybit to receive my money, then immediately the bybit system changed my wallet address and that is how the money was gone.UID: 149383188New case number: 12046978It's a shame that bybit would have to scam people by changing their wallet addresses over an app update, refuse to reimburse the money, refuse to reply their messages, refuse to attend to the case for months. Then when the user runs to trustpilot, all of a sudden their customer care becomes immediately free to attend to the user in matter of minutes.All the two cases I previously opened on this issue was closed by the scamming platform.Please reimburse my money, I will open a case in Dubai about this, trust me, these evidences on public display is more than enough to shutdown ByBit if my money isn't reimbursed."

Then when the user runs to trustpilot, all of a sudden their customer care becomes immediately free to attend to the user in matter of minutes.All the two cases I previously opened on this issue was closed by the scamming platform.Please reimburse my money, I will open a case in Dubai about this, trust me, these evidences on public display is more than enough to shutdown ByBit if my money isn't reimbursed."

My university has already been reprimanded that if I do not pay for my studies until 29.08.2024, I will be expelled from my university, which is very, very frustrating, and the problem is already solved bybit for 15-20 days."

I wrote a mail to their compliance team, nothing was yet done about it. Binance confirmed this transaction was successful. It is actually criminal for bybit to receive my money, then immediately the bybit system changed my wallet address and that is how the money was gone.UID: 149383188New case number: 12046978It's a shame that bybit would have to scam people by changing their wallet addresses over an app update, refuse to reimburse the money, refuse to reply their messages, refuse to attend to the case for months. Then when the user runs to trustpilot, all of a sudden their customer care becomes immediately free to attend to the user in matter of minutes.All the two cases I previously opened on this issue was closed by the scamming platform.Please reimburse my money, I will open a case in Dubai about this, trust me, these evidences on public display is more than enough to shutdown ByBit if my money isn't reimbursed."

My university has already been reprimanded that if I do not pay for my studies until 29.08.2024, I will be expelled from my university, which is very, very frustrating, and the problem is already solved bybit for 15-20 days."

Positive feedback focuses on the benefits of stablecoins, regulatory clarity, and educational content, which are appreciated for their credibility and informative value. However, critical issues include exaggerated claims, urgent investment calls, and a lack of transparency, leading to perceived manipulation and trust issues. Common areas of concern also involve poor customer service, false advertising, and unfulfilled promises, which contribute to the overall negative sentiment. To improve, Huobi should address these trust and transparency issues, enhance customer service, and ensure that their advertising and promises are accurate and reliable.",

IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

I made sure I completed my KYC before making any deposits and start trading, following after an advice from one of the victims of their sharp practices. I would never have decided to do business with them if not of the restrictions imposed on many of the other CEX by the government of my country.After completing my KYC, l made a deposit of about $65 in usdt, as well as an airdrop of about  $Dogs 31,127 tokens on the platform. I've been actively trading on the platform for about two months before the occurrence of this incident. I woke up on the 5th of September to monitor a couple of trades I already had in progress, only to discover that the app refused to launch on startup. I contacted a friend who also trades on the app if he was having the same experience to ascertain if it was a general problem. I sent a mail to the Bybit support after discovering it was not. I didn't receive any response from them, apart from an automated reply promising to respond between 5-7 working days. A few days after that I decided to give it another try and the app launched. But couldn't login to my account using the compulsory 2FA Google Authenticator. Eventually, I was able to log in using my Google account. To my surprise and horror I discovered that my entire assets has been wiped out. To further add salt to injury, I was required to do another round of verification and proceed to make further deposits before I can start trading.Before now each time I logged into my account I would see \"verified lv 2 user\" next to my profile.All this bears the Hallmark of a Rougue CEX. Please Bybit I need the restoration of all my assets, including my active trades."

IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

I made sure I completed my KYC before making any deposits and start trading, following after an advice from one of the victims of their sharp practices. I would never have decided to do business with them if not of the restrictions imposed on many of the other CEX by the government of my country.After completing my KYC, l made a deposit of about $65 in usdt, as well as an airdrop of about  $Dogs 31,127 tokens on the platform. I've been actively trading on the platform for about two months before the occurrence of this incident. I woke up on the 5th of September to monitor a couple of trades I already had in progress, only to discover that the app refused to launch on startup. I contacted a friend who also trades on the app if he was having the same experience to ascertain if it was a general problem. I sent a mail to the Bybit support after discovering it was not. I didn't receive any response from them, apart from an automated reply promising to respond between 5-7 working days. A few days after that I decided to give it another try and the app launched. But couldn't login to my account using the compulsory 2FA Google Authenticator. Eventually, I was able to log in using my Google account. To my surprise and horror I discovered that my entire assets has been wiped out. To further add salt to injury, I was required to do another round of verification and proceed to make further deposits before I can start trading.Before now each time I logged into my account I would see \"verified lv 2 user\" next to my profile.All this bears the Hallmark of a Rougue CEX. Please Bybit I need the restoration of all my assets, including my active trades."

I usually hold my comments when it comes to any bad service considering it as a potential coincidence. But this platform made me absolutely furious. They blocked my savings due to \"suspicious activity\" stating that someone may have accessed my funds. I checked, and only I performed any actions on my account. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

I have asked for a refund as Bybit security should have picked up that I was sending money to a scam site through wallets. This all happened within the last week so timing was quick. But Bybit do not seem to be seeing this as urgent. It is a major scam. The scammers have cloned a well known watch jewellery clothing enterprise. All I want is my money returned and the bonus would be for the scammers to be exposed so no one else loses money. Other then that  to be honest I like the Bybit platform. If anyone from Bybit is reading this and can help and not just suggest to wait two days etc I would appreciate a comment. UPDATE - Bybit Customer Support will not reply now. Stating I have to wait 7 days after submitting my issue. . I am at a loss as to what to do! Realising the quicker this is dealt with the better the chance the scammers are stopped and funds are retrieved I want to take this further but all options seem to block me. Does Bybit not realize how urgent this is??In thier own words ''Bybit is here to support your journey with integrity, reliability'' Really ???"

                "review": "I started using bybit about 2 months ago. I made sure I completed my KYC before making any deposits and start trading, following after an advice from one of the victims of their sharp practices. I would never have decided to do business with them if not of the restrictions imposed on many of the other CEX by the government of my country.After completing my KYC, l made a deposit of about $65 in usdt, as well as an airdrop of about  $Dogs 31,127 tokens on the platform. I've been actively trading on the platform for about two months before the occurrence of this incident. I woke up on the 5th of September to monitor a couple of trades I already had in progress, only to discover that the app refused to launch on startup. I contacted a friend who also trades on the app if he was having the same experience to ascertain if it was a general problem. I sent a mail to the Bybit support after discovering it was not. I didn't receive any response from them, apart from an automated reply promising to respond between 5-7 working days. A few days after that I decided to give it another try and the app launched. But couldn't login to my account using the compulsory 2FA Google Authenticator. Eventually, I was able to log in using my Google account. To my surprise and horror I discovered that my entire assets has been wiped out. To further add salt to injury, I was required to do another round of verification and proceed to make further deposits before I can start trading.Before now each time I logged into my account I would see \"verified lv 2 user\" next to my profile.All this bears the Hallmark of a Rougue CEX. Please Bybit I need the restoration of all my assets, including my active trades."

They blocked my savings due to \"suspicious activity\" stating that someone may have accessed my funds. I checked, and only I performed any actions on my account. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

I have asked for a refund as Bybit security should have picked up that I was sending money to a scam site through wallets. This all happened within the last week so timing was quick. But Bybit do not seem to be seeing this as urgent. It is a major scam. The scammers have cloned a well known watch jewellery clothing enterprise. All I want is my money returned and the bonus would be for the scammers to be exposed so no one else loses money. Other then that  to be honest I like the Bybit platform. If anyone from Bybit is reading this and can help and not just suggest to wait two days etc I would appreciate a comment. UPDATE - Bybit Customer Support will not reply now. Stating I have to wait 7 days after submitting my issue. . I am at a loss as to what to do! Realising the quicker this is dealt with the better the chance the scammers are stopped and funds are retrieved I want to take this further but all options seem to block me. Does Bybit not realize how urgent this is??In thier own words ''Bybit is here to support your journey with integrity, reliability'' Really ??? UPDATE In reply to Bybits comment below, the only reply from Bybit I have received by email is to give me a case number. No other email regarding the progress or refund! And yes I have looked in spam also. This is such an urgent case I would have thought it would have been taken more seriously and a gesture of goodwill offered."

                "review": "I have been using bybit services for 2 years. I encountered a problem with p2p. The main user agreement is that you are responsible for your own funds. Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389. I can make more arguments for the wrongness of bybit. Apparently the guys find \"free money\" for liquidity that way."

Copytrading, MT5 integration - pretty useful for ones who know how to work with these!Awesome API for developers, out-of-the-box trading bots for non-developers. Fairly transparent system with a comprehensive Knowledge Base explaining basically all concepts you need to know to trade on the exchange.Loving it! <3"

IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389. I can make more arguments for the wrongness of bybit. Apparently the guys find \"free money\" for liquidity that way."

I usually hold my comments when it comes to any bad service considering it as a potential coincidence. But this platform made me absolutely furious. They blocked my savings due to \"suspicious activity\" stating that someone may have accessed my funds. I checked, and only I performed any actions on my account. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

The impersonal tone and promotional language in many reviews raise concerns about their authenticity, suggesting possible bot activity. This inconsistency in review authenticity and the quality of customer support are critical areas that need attention. To improve, the company should focus on enhancing technical reliability and customer support services, and further investigate the authenticity of the reviews to ensure genuine user feedback.",

Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389. I can make more arguments for the wrongness of bybit. Apparently the guys find \"free money\" for liquidity that way."

IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389. I can make more arguments for the wrongness of bybit. Apparently the guys find \"free money\" for liquidity that way."

After waiting for days and not seeing the funds credited to my account, I contacted Bybit's customer support. They informed me that the deposit would be refunded, and I provided all the necessary documents.However, every time I reach out to their support, I\u2019m told to wait another 7 days. It\u2019s now been over 20 days since the initial deposit, and I still haven\u2019t received the refund. I\u2019ve even been told by their live chat agents that my case is being \"expedited,\" but there have been no real updates. I\u2019m starting to lose trust in the platform.UPDATE - 30 SEPTEMBER 2024:After weeks of waiting and several follow-ups, Bybit finally credited the funds, but not in the way I had requested. Instead of refunding the money to my bank account, the funds were credited to my Bybit wallet, causing further confusion and inconvenience. This inefficiency led to the loss of a valuable investment opportunity.While the issue is partially resolved, Bybit needs to significantly improve how they handle customer requests and their response times. Overall, this experience was disappointing."

After waiting for days and not seeing the funds credited to my account, I contacted Bybit's customer support. They informed me that the deposit would be refunded, and I provided all the necessary documents.However, every time I reach out to their support, I\u2019m told to wait another 7 days. It\u2019s now been over 20 days since the initial deposit, and I still haven\u2019t received the refund. I\u2019ve even been told by their live chat agents that my case is being \"expedited,\" but there have been no real updates. I\u2019m starting to lose trust in the platform.UPDATE - 30 SEPTEMBER 2024:After weeks of waiting and several follow-ups, Bybit finally credited the funds, but not in the way I had requested. Instead of refunding the money to my bank account, the funds were credited to my Bybit wallet, causing further confusion and inconvenience. This inefficiency led to the loss of a valuable investment opportunity.While the issue is partially resolved, Bybit needs to significantly improve how they handle customer requests and their response times. Overall, this experience was disappointing."

Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389.

IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

If the camera or facial recognition doesn't work, you are SOL, because writing out to customer service does nothing to resolve the problem. This is NOT common industry practice. They do this to keep your funds and not let you withdraw.

You\u2019re running an exchange which is a financial institution, but you\u2019re acting so unprofessional and as folks who are running Ponzi schemes.Return my money back to me, I need to fix myself because I\u2019m presently homeless because of you. This money doesn\u2019t belong you and if anything should happen to me, you\u2019re responsible for it"

Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389. I can make more arguments for the wrongness of bybit. Apparently the guys find \"free money\" for liquidity that way."

They informed me that the deposit would be refunded, and I provided all the necessary documents.However, every time I reach out to their support, I\u2019m told to wait another 7 days. It\u2019s now been over 20 days since the initial deposit, and I still haven\u2019t received the refund. I\u2019ve even been told by their live chat agents that my case is being \"expedited,\" but there have been no real updates. I\u2019m starting to lose trust in the platform.UPDATE - 30 SEPTEMBER 2024:After weeks of waiting and several follow-ups, Bybit finally credited the funds, but not in the way I had requested. Instead of refunding the money to my bank account, the funds were credited to my Bybit wallet, causing further confusion and inconvenience. This inefficiency led to the loss of a valuable investment opportunity.While the issue is partially resolved, Bybit needs to significantly improve how they handle customer requests and their response times. Overall, this experience was disappointing."

IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS since they barely do anything - they don't have any live support and share only scripted replies with no additional comments. And yes they usually reply once per week or two. Hence for two months straight all the money that I've been saving for years is taken from me. NEVER USE THIS PLATFORM unless you are willing them to \"secure\" your funds from yourself"

In short, Bybit requires that you have a working camera on your PC and do facial recognition EVERY time you wish to withdraw your funds. If the camera or facial recognition doesn't work, you are SOL, because writing out to customer service does nothing to resolve the problem. This is NOT common industry practice. They do this to keep your funds and not let you withdraw.

I\u2019m sleeping outside the cold weather. I have raised this issue here 3 times now and you only respond dubiously without doing anything. What is the reason you\u2019re withholding my Usdt? Is there anything or evidence you wanted i haven\u2019t provided you? You\u2019ve confirmed this Usdt (5,512.13 and 860.1) are with you and it belongs to me, then why have you refused to return it back to me?

                "review": "UID 50714378 My experience with Bybit has been highly unsatisfactory. Initially, I used the platform to execute Stop Loss orders to minimize losses effectively. However, I ended up facing unexpected losses due to incorrect order execution, along with conflicting information provided by the support team regarding the settings I chose.Detailed Order Information:1. Order ID: e659527eContract: BANANAUSDTOrder Type: Partial Limit Stop LossDirection: Close ShortQuantity: 282.38Trigger Price: 46.17Order Price: 46.17Status: CanceledOrder Cancelled Time (UTC): 2024-10-04 10:02:082. Order ID: b29c05abContract: BANANAUSDTOrder Type: MarketFilled Quantity: 282.38/282.38Filled Price: 46.831Status: FilledSummary of the Issue: I set a Stop Loss order using the correct settings, including choosing \"Partial Stop Loss\" to mitigate risks. However, the order was not executed when the trigger price of 46.17 was reached. Instead, the order was completely canceled. Later, a market order was executed at 46.831, which is significantly higher than the price I specified, leading to an unexpected loss.My Experience with Customer Support: I reached out to the support team multiple times for clarification and compensation regarding the losses. However, there were inconsistencies in their responses:During the chat with support, I was told that I had used the \"Reduce Only\" option, while in the email response, I was informed that the order was a \"Partial Limit Stop Loss.\" This inconsistency in information indicates a lack of credibility from the support team.When I requested compensation for the losses caused by the incorrect execution, I received no clear answer regarding the refund, and my request was continuously ignored, which left me feeling extremely frustrated.Conclusion: I expected Bybit, as a globally recognized trading platform, to be more professional and transparent in handling customer issues, especially when system errors lead to financial losses. However, my experience has been filled with contradictions and frustration due to incorrect order execution, conflicting information provided by support, and avoidance of any compensation for the losses.My Final Request: I demand full compensation for the amount lost due to this execution error, and I warn any trader against trusting the platform without verifying its reliability and customer service."

Nothing bad has ever happened for two years. Today I made a purchase in p2p for 426$, two hours later I had to pay with cryptocurrency. And then when withdrawing I see a small inscription that funds are frozen. Damn... in tech support they say their \"super\" security system can do this because of anomalous activity or something. I hadn't made any transactions for a week up to that point. Oh yeah, I wasn't even warned in any way that funds could be frozen. Although their \"super\" system should have shown a \"T+1\" notification window, but that didn't happen. As they said in tech support, you need to clean the cache. Everyone clears their cache before opening p2p, right? Extremely disappointed, if I had known I would have bought via telegram. My order would be: 1838268731174543360. UID: 37089389.

After passing login (i.e. username, password, email auth, 2FA)  then to do just a simple withdrawal you must complete again ... email auth, then 2FA auth, and also facial recognition! In short, Bybit requires that you have a working camera on your PC and do facial recognition EVERY time you wish to withdraw your funds. If the camera or facial recognition doesn't work, you are SOL, because writing out to customer service does nothing to resolve the problem. This is NOT common industry practice. They do this to keep your funds and not let you withdraw. They claim security or safety for the user - this is a lie and pretext to make it as hard as possible to access your funds when you need them. This is disingenuous.***STAY AWAY***"

After passing login (i.e. username, password, email auth, 2FA)  then to do just a simple withdrawal you must complete again ... email auth, then 2FA auth, and also facial recognition! In short, Bybit requires that you have a working camera on your PC and do facial recognition EVERY time you wish to withdraw your funds. If the camera or facial recognition doesn't work, you are SOL, because writing out to customer service does nothing to resolve the problem. This is NOT common industry practice. They do this to keep your funds and not let you withdraw. They claim security or safety for the user - this is a lie and pretext to make it as hard as possible to access your funds when you need them. This is disingenuous.***STAY AWAY***"

Financial inclusivity is addressed through the lens of decentralized finance (DeFi) growth, suggesting that DeFi could play a significant role in expanding access to financial services.

To this day, I haven\u2019t received a single substantial answer to my questions: On what grounds were my funds blocked? Please provide documented justification. An EML check takes 3 minutes. Why are funds being held for weeks and months? This is illegal. There are laws and legal precedents that confirm this. The fact that you have \"a lot of work\" is your problem, not the clients'. Expand your staff. Where did my 4% of the amount go after the funds were unblocked? Provide a documented explanation. The exchange remains silent on these questions. Requesting details for official notifications will also remain unanswered. That's because there are no answers to these questions. Any response from these unscrupulous money-grabbers would incriminate them. You are being watched, and you are slowly being held accountable. Market makers, who are currently being taken down, are proof of this. You will also get what\u2019s coming to you. When you gorge yourself without limits, a twisted gut is inevitable.

They charge you fees for entering, leaving and staying, for everything and the PNL is, and get used to it, on average 50% of what they tell you. On the contrary, the BingX Exchange, when they tell you that you are going to earn those 10 USD, you earn them even by leaving Market.El gran problema de este exchange es que es muy caro. Si tu vas ganando 10 USD y te dicen vas ganando 10 USD cuando te sales a Limit te quitan entre el 50 al 75% de tu ganancia si es que no es mas y sales en contra. Te cobran tarifas por entrar, salir y permanecer, por todo y el PNL es, y acostumbrate, en promedio 50% de lo que ellos te dicen.

Initially, the experience was positive, but several issues have soured my opinion:Pros:- Good performance in the first month of useCons:1. Expensive fees compared to competitors2. Poor handling of P2P system scams3. Inadequate customer service relying heavily on bots4. Slow response to fraud reportsI encountered a scammer on their P2P system, which is unfortunately common in crypto. However, Bybit's response was disappointingly slow and ineffective. They seem to prioritize automated responses over actual human intervention, allowing scammers to continue operating unchecked.My support case (ID: 12930150) has been poorly managed, making me question my decision to switch from Binance. Bybit had potential, but these issues need urgent eattention. And no resolution has been met the scammer is free and my funds gone kindly follow up on this."

In reality, all of your issues related to stolen funds will remain unresolved. I understand the EML check and KYC process, but manipulation and theft do not fall under that category. To this day, I haven\u2019t received a single substantial answer to my questions: On what grounds were my funds blocked? Please provide documented justification. An EML check takes 3 minutes. Why are funds being held for weeks and months? This is illegal. There are laws and legal precedents that confirm this. The fact that you have \"a lot of work\" is your problem, not the clients'. Expand your staff. Where did my 4% of the amount go after the funds were unblocked? Provide a documented explanation. The exchange remains silent on these questions. Requesting details for official notifications will also remain unanswered. That's because there are no answers to these questions. Any response from these unscrupulous money-grabbers would incriminate them. You are being watched, and you are slowly being held accountable. Market makers, who are currently being taken down, are proof of this. You will also get what\u2019s coming to you. When you gorge yourself without limits, a twisted gut is inevitable.

They charge you fees for entering, leaving and staying, for everything and the PNL is, and get used to it, on average 50% of what they tell you. On the contrary, the BingX Exchange, when they tell you that you are going to earn those 10 USD, you earn them even by leaving Market.El gran problema de este exchange es que es muy caro. Si tu vas ganando 10 USD y te dicen vas ganando 10 USD cuando te sales a Limit te quitan entre el 50 al 75% de tu ganancia si es que no es mas y sales en contra. Te cobran tarifas por entrar, salir y permanecer, por todo y el PNL es, y acostumbrate, en promedio 50% de lo que ellos te dicen. Al contrario el Exchange BingX , cuando te dicen, vas a ganar esos 10 USD, los ganas incluso saliendote a Market."

Poor handling of P2P system scams3. Inadequate customer service relying heavily on bots4. Slow response to fraud reportsI encountered a scammer on their P2P system, which is unfortunately common in crypto. However, Bybit's response was disappointingly slow and ineffective. They seem to prioritize automated responses over actual human intervention, allowing scammers to continue operating unchecked.My support case (ID: 12930150) has been poorly managed, making me question my decision to switch from other exchanges. Bybit has potential, but these issues need urgent attention. And no resolution has been met the scammer is free and my funds gone kindly follow up on this. MY UID IS: 219912273"

They charge you fees for entering, leaving and staying, for everything and the PNL is, and get used to it, on average 50% of what they tell you. On the contrary, the BingX Exchange, when they tell you that you are going to earn those 10 USD, you earn them even by leaving Market.El gran problema de este exchange es que es muy caro. Si tu vas ganando 10 USD y te dicen vas ganando 10 USD cuando te sales a Limit te quitan entre el 50 al 75% de tu ganancia si es que no es mas y sales en contra. Te cobran tarifas por entrar, salir y permanecer, por todo y el PNL es, y acostumbrate, en promedio 50% de lo que ellos te dicen.

Slow response to fraud reportsI encountered a scammer on their P2P system, which is unfortunately common in crypto. However, Bybit's response was disappointingly slow and ineffective. They seem to prioritize automated responses over actual human intervention, allowing scammers to continue operating unchecked.My support case (ID: 12930150) has been poorly managed, making me question my decision to switch from other exchanges.

Bybit listens and cares about its customers and I can point out to the futures martingale grid bot and grid bots being included in copytrading for master traders to trade using grid bots and earn when their followers copy their grid bot trades as one of the feedbacks that I gave and it was implemented. So Bybit is not just one of the best trading platforms in the world but they listen to their customers."

Thankfully, I was able to withdraw my funds. However, the stress and uncertainty made me realize the importance of owning your private keys. I\u2019ll never use a centralized exchange (CEX) again.Not your keys, not your coins\u2014I had to learn that the hard way by almost losing everything I worked hard for. While my issue is resolved now, I still cannot recommend Bybit after such a stressful experience."

I have been trading on Bybit actively since October 2021 and I have seen it grow to become one of the top 3 exchanges in the world. Bybit listens and cares about its customers and I can point out to the futures martingale grid bot and grid bots being included in copytrading for master traders to trade using grid bots and earn when their followers copy their grid bot trades as one of the feedbacks that I gave and it was implemented. So Bybit is not just one of the best trading platforms in the world but they listen to their customers."

I never received any follow up email.  Then last week 11th October I transferred all of my assets to them and then realised i can no longer trade Futures so went to withdraw my ASSETS and i am blocked from withdrawing due to suspicious activity, I sent numerous emails and am met with no response even after sending them a video and new KYC information and they also want to unbind my GA which is dodgy in itself.  It seems that this is not a one off and maybe they have had a data breach and they are not letting on.  There support is appaling and they are thieves so I  would not even consider using them ever again, they still hold my deposit for my house and they do not communicate, they literally have stolen money and believe they are above the law, I will be contacting a lawyer and notifying the FMA here in NZ of their actions hoping they will ban them from even being able to offer any form of service here.  Again if they want to give me back my assets then i will take this post down but until then I shall be posting everywhere i can think of. My case number is  13112393."

Everything was fine, no issues at all, until I started putting more money into my account. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, you guys blocked my account over a $100 withdrawal, claiming it was \"suspicious.\"For 100$ withdrawal you blocked all my assets - around 13 000$, that I invested in the last year.I need those assets to travel and to live!I am not a scammer or what you could guess about me. I am 100% verified user with 100% proofs of funds. I gave you all the documents you asked for to prove everything is legit\u2014bank checks, tax certificates, everything. But after that, it\u2019s been radio silence... No updates, no replies. What\u2019s going on?I trusted Bybit as a platform, but this whole experience is shaking that trust big time. I\u2019m just asking for a proper review and some communication. If you need more info from me, I\u2019m ready to provide it, but please, let's get this sorted out. It\u2019s been way too long.Looking forward to hearing from you (finally).My uuid: 125084968Case number is #12758187"

A few weeks ago, my crypto debit card stopped working, and shortly after, they blocked my ability to withdraw any funds. While I could still trade, I was completely locked out of accessing my own money, which was incredibly infuriating.I complied with every verification request, including sending a selfie video with my ID and a handwritten note, plus both the front and back of my ID and driver's license. Despite my efforts, I received nothing but automated responses from support for over three weeks.After escalating the issue by reaching out to higher-ups globally at Bybit, the problem was finally resolved faster than I expected\u2014but only because I had to make a scene. Thankfully, I was able to withdraw my funds. However, the stress and uncertainty made me realize the importance of owning your private keys. I\u2019ll never use a centralized exchange (CEX) again.Not your keys, not your coins\u2014I had to learn that the hard way by almost losing everything I worked hard for. While my issue is resolved now, I still cannot recommend Bybit after such a stressful experience."

I have been trading on Bybit actively since October 2021 and I have seen it grow to become one of the top 3 exchanges in the world. Bybit listens and cares about its customers and I can point out to the futures martingale grid bot and grid bots being included in copytrading for master traders to trade using grid bots and earn when their followers copy their grid bot trades as one of the feedbacks that I gave and it was implemented. So Bybit is not just one of the best trading platforms in the world but they listen to their customers."

Everything was fine, no issues at all, until I started putting more money into my account. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, you guys blocked my account over a $100 withdrawal, claiming it was \"suspicious.\"For 100$ withdrawal you blocked all my assets - around 13 000$, that I invested in the last year.I need those assets to travel and to live!I am not a scammer or what you could guess about me. I am 100% verified user with 100% proofs of funds. I gave you all the documents you asked for to prove everything is legit\u2014bank checks, tax certificates, everything. But after that, it\u2019s been radio silence... No updates, no replies. What\u2019s going on?I trusted Bybit as a platform, but this whole experience is shaking that trust big time. I\u2019m just asking for a proper review and some communication. If you need more info from me, I\u2019m ready to provide it, but please, let's get this sorted out. It\u2019s been way too long.Looking forward to hearing from you (finally).My uuid: 125084968Case number is #12758187"

A few weeks ago, my crypto debit card stopped working, and shortly after, they blocked my ability to withdraw any funds. While I could still trade, I was completely locked out of accessing my own money, which was incredibly infuriating.I complied with every verification request, including sending a selfie video with my ID and a handwritten note, plus both the front and back of my ID and driver's license. Despite my efforts, I received nothing but automated responses from support for over three weeks.After escalating the issue by reaching out to higher-ups globally at Bybit, the problem was finally resolved faster than I expected\u2014but only because I had to make a scene. Thankfully, I was able to withdraw my funds. However, the stress and uncertainty made me realize the importance of owning your private keys. I\u2019ll never use a centralized exchange (CEX) again.Not your keys, not your coins\u2014I had to learn that the hard way by almost losing everything I worked hard for. While my issue is resolved now, I still cannot recommend Bybit after such a stressful experience."

I have been trading on Bybit actively since October 2021 and I have seen it grow to become one of the top 3 exchanges in the world. Bybit listens and cares about its customers and I can point out to the futures martingale grid bot and grid bots being included in copytrading for master traders to trade using grid bots and earn when their followers copy their grid bot trades as one of the feedbacks that I gave and it was implemented. So Bybit is not just one of the best trading platforms in the world but they listen to their customers."

I have provided video evidence to the customer care in charge of case that the buyer never made any payment to me but the customer care support for some unknown reasons has refused to ask the buyer to send video proof that they actually made any payments.The fact that the customer care in the case hasnt even asked the buyer for a video proof showing he actually made a payment to me is suspicious and paints the company in bad light.LIke this is over $13,000 of my coins being held ransome by this fraudulent buyer for 4 days now. i have video proof to back up my evidence and the buyer has provided none but yet the support seems to favour the buyer who is yet to provide an evidence of payment.My UID is 51386080Case ID is #13290020p2p Order IDs where the buyer is holding my $13,355 and claiming to have made payment is 1849101474010058752There are two p2p appeal that was created by the buyer also claiming to have made payment with no proof.p2p Order IDs are18491915583401779201849200270179545088"

My Bybit card has suddenly been blocked \"due to compliance reasons,\" even though I submitted all required documents, including billing statements and explanations, just a few weeks ago. This isn\u2019t the first time either; my card was blocked previously, and it took more than four weeks just to receive an update.What\u2019s even worse is that the issue seems to be getting worse. The \u201cSubmit\u201d button on the document upload page doesn\u2019t even work, making it impossible for me to resubmit any information if needed. At this point, I\u2019m resigned to wasting months back-and-forth with support, responding to tickets, and hoping for a resolution. This experience is beyond frustrating.This has pushed me to the point where I\u2019m actively considering switching to another crypto exchange. I\u2019ve lost trust in Bybit\u2019s ability to support its users, especially long-term ones like myself. I hope Bybit takes this feedback seriously, as this ongoing inefficiency is incredibly disappointing and nerve-wracking.UID: 105050267EDIT1: Here is case number #13283666EDIT 2:Only after 2 days after card was blocked I have received an email with the reason ,in additional it is written that if you believe that card was blocked by the error I can submit ticket,but ticket was already submitted yesterday what should I do now ?Should I create additional ticket ?"

A few weeks ago, my crypto debit card stopped working, and shortly after, they blocked my ability to withdraw any funds. While I could still trade, I was completely locked out of accessing my own money, which was incredibly infuriating.I complied with every verification request, including sending a selfie video with my ID and a handwritten note, plus both the front and back of my ID and driver's license. Despite my efforts, I received nothing but automated responses from support for over three weeks.After escalating the issue by reaching out to higher-ups globally at Bybit, the problem was finally resolved faster than I expected\u2014but only because I had to make a scene. Thankfully, I was able to withdraw my funds. However, the stress and uncertainty made me realize the importance of owning your private keys. I\u2019ll never use a centralized exchange (CEX) again.Not your keys, not your coins\u2014I had to learn that the hard way by almost losing everything I worked hard for. While my issue is resolved now, I still cannot recommend Bybit after such a stressful experience."

Bybit listens and cares about its customers and I can point out to the futures martingale grid bot and grid bots being included in copytrading for master traders to trade using grid bots and earn when their followers copy their grid bot trades as one of the feedbacks that I gave and it was implemented. So Bybit is not just one of the best trading platforms in the world but they listen to their customers."

                "review": "I\u2019m reaching out regarding an unresolved transaction issue with my Bybit card, and I would greatly appreciate bybit assistance in resolving it as soon as possible.I\u2019ve been a loyal user of the Bybit exchange and card for almost a year, preferring it for daily transactions over my bank credit card. In the past six months alone, I\u2019ve made payments totaling over \u20ac50.000 using this card. However, I recently encountered a problem with a transaction dated October 21st.On that date, I attempted a payment of \u20ac620 to a company I order from regularly. Unfortunately, this payment never arrived with the merchant. After reaching out to them, they canceled the order two days later to prevent further issues. Despite my efforts to resolve this through multiple Bybit support channels (screenshots attached), communication has been inconsistent, and responses so far haven\u2019t addressed or clarified how to resolve the problem. I got sent from the normal customer service, to compliance, from compliance to the live chat and live chat doesn't work because there is nobody to talk to!As it stands, the \u20ac620 is still frozen in my Bybit account with a status of \"In Progress.\" Could you please look into this matter or direct it to the appropriate department if necessary? Any assistance or guidance on what steps I should take next would be immensely helpful. After the resolving i will change my review but this is just a very bad look. I use this card over my credit card from the bank. If i used that one, i would have had my money back 100 times because there is a normal way of communication. That seems to be hard with this customer service...Uid: 113425315Case id: 13336217UPDATED with the requested info."

Bad reviews destroy trust. PLEASE deposit my money, that i transfered from my bank account in my bybit account."

In the past six months alone, I\u2019ve made payments totaling over \u20ac50.000 using this card. However, I recently encountered a problem with a transaction dated October 21st.On that date, I attempted a payment of \u20ac620 to a company I order from regularly. Unfortunately, this payment never arrived with the merchant. After reaching out to them, they canceled the order two days later to prevent further issues. Despite my efforts to resolve this through multiple Bybit support channels (screenshots attached), communication has been inconsistent, and responses so far haven\u2019t addressed or clarified how to resolve the problem. I got sent from the normal customer service, to compliance, from compliance to the live chat and live chat doesn't work because there is nobody to talk to!As it stands, the \u20ac620 is still frozen in my Bybit account with a status of \"In Progress.\" Could you please look into this matter or direct it to the appropriate department if necessary? Any assistance or guidance on what steps I should take next would be immensely helpful. After the resolving i will change my review but this is just a very bad look. I use this card over my credit card from the bank. If i used that one, i would have had my money back 100 times because there is a normal way of communication. That seems to be hard with this customer service...Uid: 113425315Case id: 13336217UPDATED with the requested info."

However, that excitement quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that Bybit has my TON rewards frozen with no clear explanation or timeline for when I can access them. Reaching out to customer service has been unhelpful, as responses are either vague or non-committal. For a platform that promotes itself as user-friendly and reliable, this experience has been extremely disappointing. If Bybit wants to build trust and maintain its reputation, it needs to improve transparency and user support. Until then, I would caution others to be wary when participating in similar promotions on their platform.\"I am willing to provide my UID to Bybit if they wish to investigate my case further.\""

While Bybit could improve in handling these cases, it\u2019s important to recognize that these incidents are not solely the platform\u2019s fault. They have shown dedication to improving their support and security over time.Beyond P2P, Bybit offers a wide range of features and tools for crypto traders and enthusiasts, setting it apart from many other exchanges.

I wired them using sepa transfer a week ago, know for a FACT they arrived seconds later in their bank (express sepa within EU) - arrived on monday. 2 days nothing, on a third day got notification it was stopped for a review and i need to file documents- did on the same day. After 2 more days out of nowhere sent requrest for NEW DOCUMENTS without any explanation WHY. No contact just spam emails, not a person behind. It was a week ago and for now i still wasn't told WHEN MY FUNDS WILL ARRIVE. And for that time my funds are NOWHERE. not in my bank account not in a bybit account. NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE. People on the chat just repeat the same line \"it takes up to two working days\" or up to 5 working days depending who you got on the other side. Total chaos, after this gets solved will never return to them."

Please speed up the process, because to analise 2 documents cannot take that long.This business is about trust, about building trust, atracting new investors that feel safe investing in crypto or stock using exchanges, trust, trust.This kind of attitude doesnt help to build trust. Bad reviews destroy trust. PLEASE deposit my money, that i transfered from my bank account in my bybit account."

Many of the negative reviews here seem to stem from issues related to P2P transactions, where some users have unfortunately encountered scams from other users. While Bybit could improve in handling these cases, it\u2019s important to recognize that these incidents are not solely the platform\u2019s fault. They have shown dedication to improving their support and security over time.Beyond P2P, Bybit offers a wide range of features and tools for crypto traders and enthusiasts, setting it apart from many other exchanges. I believe the current ratings are not fully reflective of the overall service quality that Bybit provides, especially considering their ongoing efforts and improvements."

Bybit needs to do proper investigation before cancelling order.

However, that excitement quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that Bybit has my TON rewards frozen with no clear explanation or timeline for when I can access them. Reaching out to customer service has been unhelpful, as responses are either vague or non-committal. For a platform that promotes itself as user-friendly and reliable, this experience has been extremely disappointing. If Bybit wants to build trust and maintain its reputation, it needs to improve transparency and user support. Until then, I would caution others to be wary when participating in similar promotions on their platform.My bybit UID :117028222CASE NO: 13365819"

While it\u2019s not perfect, they are continually growing and putting in significant effort to scale their platform and deliver quality services. Many of the negative reviews here seem to stem from issues related to P2P transactions, where some users have unfortunately encountered scams from other users. While Bybit could improve in handling these cases, it\u2019s important to recognize that these incidents are not solely the platform\u2019s fault. They have shown dedication to improving their support and security over time.Beyond P2P, Bybit offers a wide range of features and tools for crypto traders and enthusiasts, setting it apart from many other exchanges. I believe the current ratings are not fully reflective of the overall service quality that Bybit provides, especially considering their ongoing efforts and improvements."

It was a week ago and for now i still wasn't told WHEN MY FUNDS WILL ARRIVE. And for that time my funds are NOWHERE. not in my bank account not in a bybit account. NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE.

No updates, no follow-ups, no solution \u2013 just silence! Now both tickets have been marked as \"RESOLVED\" without a single word from Bybit.This level of disregard for customers is completely unacceptable. How can they resolve a ticket without actually resolving anything? Bybit clearly doesn't care about its users or providing any real support. If you're looking for a reliable platform, look elsewhere because Bybit\u2019s support is a JOKE!EDIT: Since I am using bybit for more than a year and never had any issues before this situation, I will think about updating review,in case my problem will be solved .But as I already said before ,I was waiting for your reply for more than week all requested information has been attached and situation has been described in full.But somehow my tickets were marked as resolved without any reply and any update."

Critical issues identified include the need for improved security measures and transparency to address user concerns about unauthorized activities. To enhance user experience and trust, further investigation into security protocols and personalized customer support could be beneficial.",

No updates, no follow-ups, no solution \u2013 just silence! Now both tickets have been marked as \"RESOLVED\" without a single word from Bybit.This level of disregard for customers is completely unacceptable. How can they resolve a ticket without actually resolving anything? Bybit clearly doesn't care about its users or providing any real support. If you're looking for a reliable platform, look elsewhere because Bybit\u2019s support is a JOKE!EDIT: Since I am using bybit for more than a year and never had any issues before this situation, I will think about updating review,in case my problem will be solved .But as I already said before ,I was waiting for your reply for more than week all requested information has been attached and situation has been described in full.But somehow my tickets were marked as resolved without any reply and any update."

Despite providing all the necessary evidence of what I believe to be a wrongful liquidation of my position, Bybit failed to resolve the issue.In my case, the highest recorded Mark Price was $2.069, which was well below my liquidation price of $2.23. I provided screenshots and detailed explanations showing this discrepancy, yet Bybit insisted that the liquidation was accurate without addressing the evidence I shared.What\u2019s worse is that after multiple attempts to communicate with their support team, my last email went unanswered, and my case was closed without any resolution. This lack of transparency and accountability is unacceptable.I expect better from a platform of Bybit\u2019s stature, and their refusal to properly investigate and address such serious concerns has completely eroded my trust in their services. I would caution others to be extremely careful when trading on Bybit, as the platform does not appear to stand by its users when issues arise.UID : 46267106"

They confirmed the funds were safe at the time (which i can prove is correct by the logs) they also said they had locked the account so the funds would stay safe..... WHICH THEY DIDNT.

I have been a loyal customer of Bybit for over two years, but the recent experience I've had with their customer service has left me in a state of disbelief and financial distress.A year ago, I lost my device and with it, my access to 2FA. I immediately reached out to Bybit's support team, providing them with all necessary identification and recent transaction details. Despite being a KYC verified account holder, I was met with an unreasonable demand - a video recording of the source account linked to the first transaction into my Bybit account from two years ago. This request is not only impractical but also impossible to fulfill logistically.The lack of understanding and empathy from the support team is astounding. I have been left in the dark, with no clear information on what's happening or why I am being denied access to my own funds. This has resulted in significant financial loss and personal distress.The inability of a company to service a simple reset of 2FA, especially when all necessary details have been provided, is unacceptable. It's been a year of back and forth with no resolution in sight. I am at a loss for words to describe the level of disappointment and frustration I feel.I urge potential users to consider this experience before choosing Bybit. The lack of effective customer support and the unreasonable demands placed on customers in times of distress is a red flag. Your funds may not be as accessible as you think. It\u2019s been a year I\u2019ve had access to mine."

It is critical to clients specially those that are still at loss. Bybit should have been a little flexible in this regard.2. Upgrading to UTA where the requirements is no open trades. Bybit is the one upgrading but why the clients are the one who will suffer when they will have no choice but to closed their trades. This kind of things which leaving the traders no choice but to close trades. Bybit should be flexible on this kind of things and not to force close the trades."

I have been waiting on 2 seperate fiat withdrawals for over 2 days now. Usually they arrive in my bank account instantly, so something is clearly wrong. Customer live chat cant help with anything and I am not hearing anything from my tickets either. I would love some quick help because I need the fiat withdrawn quick and cant wait for weeks. If I get the support I need I would love to change my review to 5 stars because apart from this I have never had any trouble with the platform. Edit: Case Number #13863127"

On 26 November 2024, I transferred BTC worth $469.73 from my Exodus wallet to Bybit (Transaction ID: 21a65aa198166dd985ad5630012505f908577cc2e68855070aeadfd587df231a).The transaction was marked for review and my my withdrawal and trading activities was suspended, and I was asked to provide details and the source of funds, which I promptly submitted. However, it\u2019s been over 24 hours, and I\u2019ve received no response or resolution (Case ID: 13832647).This lack of communication is unacceptable and undermines trust in the platform. I urge Bybit to address this promptly.I reported the above case earlier on here and I was assured that the case will be looked into but it\u2019s over 24hrs since my first review and I still haven\u2019t gotten any update from bybit. It\u2019s no longer funny as the whole of my life savings is on there and I can\u2019t even make any withdrawal."

I provided it and the first time I was just silently rejected. The second time I also uploaded a certificate that I received from my employer with a stamp and signature of my employer. After that I got a letter that I was permanently blocked from posting ads. I wrote them a letter that I am ready to confirm by any means, a photo of myself with a certificate, a photo with the employer, with the employer's documents, in general any way I can confirm everything, I have everything official. The platform is full of fake accounts, trading with third-party cards and so on.

The previous ones were accepted fine, but within a minute the system automatically flagged this one as abnormal for some reason. I was not given an opportunity to appeal or provide details. With other exchanges, banks and the tax agency I've never had an issue with KYC/AML as I can provide documentation, but I was never given that option with Bybit.My only option was to withdraw the BTC to a new address with a fee of 0.025 BTC, over 1000x higher than the actual network fee, and at the time worth about 2000 EUR. I was lured in with the cashback, gamification and offers, but it ended up costing me money instead of saving.Beware if you make crypto deposits to Bybit they can without explanation flag it as abnormal and take huge fees from you. If you wish to deposit crypto instead choose an exchange where compliance is reachable and run by humans, not automated.Two stars instead of one because the support employees I had contact with did take time for me, but ultimately were not able to explain why my deposit was flagged or restore the fee, and compliance never responded to me."

On 26 November 2024, I transferred BTC worth $469.73 from my Exodus wallet to Bybit (Transaction ID: 21a65aa198166dd985ad5630012505f908577cc2e68855070aeadfd587df231a).The transaction was marked for review and my my withdrawal and trading activities was suspended, and I was asked to provide details and the source of funds, which I promptly submitted. However, it\u2019s been over  7 days, and I\u2019ve received no response or resolution (Case ID: 13832647).This lack of communication is unacceptable and undermines trust in the platform. I urge Bybit to address this promptly.I reported the above case earlier on here and I was assured that the case will be looked into but it\u2019s over 5days since my first review and I still haven\u2019t gotten any update from bybit. It\u2019s no longer funny as the whole of my life savings is on there and I can\u2019t even make any withdrawal."

The previous ones were accepted fine, but within a minute the system automatically flagged this one as abnormal for some reason. I was not given an opportunity to appeal or provide details. With other exchanges, banks and the tax agency I've never had an issue with KYC/AML as I can provide documentation, but I was never given that option with Bybit.My only option was to withdraw the BTC to a new address with a fee of 0.025 BTC, over 1000x higher than the actual network fee, and at the time worth about 2000 EUR. I was lured in with the cashback, gamification and offers, but it ended up costing me money instead of saving.Beware if you make crypto deposits to Bybit they can without explanation flag it as abnormal and take huge fees from you. If you wish to deposit crypto instead choose an exchange where compliance is reachable and run by humans, not automated.Two stars instead of one because the support employees I had contact with did take time for me, but ultimately were not able to explain why my deposit was flagged or restore the fee, and compliance never responded to me.Case number: 13319149"

For example, I was offered a reward of 10 USDT for registration, passing KYC and making a deposit of $100. After I fulfilled these conditions and tried to collect 10 USDT, an error notification popped up, and then all mention of these unfortunate 10 USDT disappeared altogether. The support team first started lying that the task was allegedly not completed on time, to which they provided evidence of their lies. Then they came up with a new excuse, like the reward reserve was exhausted. But then in this case, why deceive the client by slipping him a dummy? After all, the task did not say anywhere that it was a lottery, but, on the contrary, it was clearly stated: top up the deposit from $100 - get 10 USDT.Below my review there will be a response from the absolutely useless Bybit support, about how sorry they are (they don't really care) with a suggestion to contact support to solve any problems (in fact it is absolutely useless, they are not able to solve any problems)."

                "review": "The only thing positive is the 10% cashback and 15% during Black Friday. Their exchange has a lot of coins and options as well. However....According to Bybit, the person I invited violated the campaign rules and regulations, giving three possible reasons but can not stipulate the exact reason. They also say: \"This decision is final, and we will not consider any further appeals on this matter.\"I guess that inviting people that don't really trade often and only using the cashback card is a violation of the terms stipulated by Bybit. This is also not appealable according to Bybit, which is bad as this shows hostile behavior against their customer. It also took 16 calender days (12 working days) to answer, which is also very poor.So don't deposit too much money and enjoy the cashback wherever possible."

The transaction was carried out via their DEX, and just a few hours after purchasing the tokens, they were gone. This isn\u2019t a case of market volatility or price drops; on Bybit\u2019s Web3 platform, your purchased crypto can simply disappear, and their support team will be of no help.It seems to me that Bybit is cutting costs on technical expertise, focusing only on marketing. I don\u2019t believe they intentionally stole my funds, but their poor technical implementation poses a serious risk to users. The fact that even they seem unaware of the root cause suggests it\u2019s down to incompetent coding.For Bybit employees: my support ticket number is 13580228."

JUST SEND THE MONEY BACK TO THE BANK ACCOUNT I USED TO DEPOSIT IT FROM. YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION ALREADY.This the first time I've encountered very slow verification process in all platforms I'm in. Also have a very slow and farfetched response from customer service. This is supposed to be one of the largest crypto platform, yet, are you trying to save money by just putting 1 or 2 people in customer service and work on thousands or millions of complaints everyday? Hire more people to handle more complaints. Outsource to cheap countries for all I care. Bitcoin just shoot up, that alone would've earned you billions of revenue."

However....According to Bybit, the person I invited violated the campaign rules and regulations, giving three possible reasons but can not stipulate the exact reason. They also say: \"This decision is final, and we will not consider any further appeals on this matter.\"I guess that inviting people that don't really trade often and only using the cashback card is a violation of the terms stipulated by Bybit. This is also not appealable according to Bybit, which is bad as this shows hostile behavior against their customer. It also took 16 calender days (12 working days) to answer, which is also very poor.So don't deposit too much money and enjoy the cashback wherever possible."

It doesn\u2019t account for unrealized losses, which are crucial to consider. For example, I followed a trader with a 0% MDD over 7 days, 2.50% MDD over 30 days and 3% MDD over 90 days, but yesterday, their entire portfolio was down 20%. Some traders can even go 30\u201340% negative before closing an order, and if they eventually close it on profit, the MDD still shows as 0% (this is the example from yesterday: they close the trade on profit yesterday, despite being over 20% on the negative, and the MDD over 7 days is still 0%).Couldn't there be an option to show both realized/unrealized MDD?
