Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

So in my personal experience they are legit and ok. Then I bought btc instead of altcoin I previously wanted to buy, and succesfuly withdrawn it. So I will use this exchange in future."

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

However, significant negative concerns are also evident, including issues with manipulated prices, withdrawal difficulties, lengthy verification processes, and blocked funds. The main themes suggest a dichotomy between the platform's operational efficiency and its trading integrity and transparency. To improve user satisfaction, TRON should address these critical issues by enhancing transparency, streamlining verification processes, and ensuring reliable withdrawal mechanisms. Further investigation into the root causes of these negative experiences could provide actionable insights for improving overall user trust and platform reliability.",

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Customer support responded, warned me that it will take about 30 days to solve this problem. They took a fee. After 32 days problem was solved, my ETH was refunded(few grand $worth). So in my personal experience they are legit and ok. Then I bought btc instead of altcoin I previously wanted to buy, and succesfuly withdrawn it. So I will use this exchange in future."

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!nebbin agility bm"

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

The discussions identified significant roadblocks for public-private partnerships (PPPs), primarily stemming from differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities. To improve these collaborations, there is a need for clearer regulatory guidelines and alignment of expectations between public and private entities. Further investigation could focus on developing standardized frameworks to facilitate smoother integration and collaboration across the financial ecosystem.",

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!nebbin agility bm"

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

So in my personal experience they are legit and ok. Then I bought btc instead of altcoin I previously wanted to buy, and succesfuly withdrawn it. So I will use this exchange in future."

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case.

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."

                "review": "Unfortunately, I think I might have also just been scammed by LBank. They sent a withdrawal to my external wallet; and then without notification froze my account. Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade. On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

On and on!  I've unfortunately, have been scammed. Lost $4k! Live an learn! Thank God is wasn't my larger balances. Beware!Their responses here on Trust Pilot are deceptive (dishonest). They try to blame scammers, but it's them. They're not releasing funds because they're using them, so pay not attention to their reply. We operate on their portal and not some scam site!nebbin agility bm"

Blamed me and said I had to send back; and I then provided them proof I made no such withdrawal request, I had no such assets in my account. Took two days and l lot of my time before they acknowledged it's their mistake (why else would they ask for me to return the withdrawal). This transaction was sent over two weeks after I had withdrawn the last asset in my account. I did note I had withdrawals issues. I sometimes had to do smaller withdrawals to withdraw some tokens. Should have raised a red flag, but I ignored. So I deposited more funds to make a purchase and I now have no access to assets; and have pending withdrawals almost weeks old! What a scam...to get access to my account I as they requested I sent this unsolicited withdrawal back (went to another exchange to buy the tokens as they would not take from existing balance in my account as I could not get at my cold wallet in bank storage).  Said I had to follow SOP? What? They also wanted the gross amount of tokens (which is after they deducted their transfer fee). What a scam (on balances I never had)! They froze my account (never informed me); it's been over week and nobody responds. I'm afraid I'll never get my money back/withdrawals. Just not sure how I missed the red flags (obviously I didn't read this thread). There is no response from the customer service email.  Live customer service sends you to HCD at lbank, and they HCD sends you back to customer services. So for over a week, I'm been going in circles - many wasted hours! What a fiasco!Broken trust and missed opportunities! Something just isn't right with Lbank.BTW, I contacted customer service from within their portal, so this is not external scam (unless the entire portal with 2FA access is a scam). Same portal from which I've received a withdrawal in September.Just shameful...make so many lies up. Waiting for you return transfer, cannot complete xrp transfer as we're waiting for an upgrade.

Always asking for more and saying that what is already provided is not enough to never unlock tokens.It's a scam, they'll never give the money back, what they want is to collect as much information as possible so they can sell it I don't know where.The emails and replies are automated, there's no human behind the keyboard, just an AI that repeats the same messages word for word, even if you ask for more details.Avoid !!!!I have sent funds to you and would like them back without exceeding the daily ceiling.

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

Critical issues identified are the repetitive patterns and generic phrasing in negative reviews, which may indicate bot-like content and detract from the user experience. To improve, there should be a focus on enhancing security measures, ensuring smoother account access, and addressing withdrawal issues, while further investigation could explore the authenticity of negative reviews and the potential for manipulation.",

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

Domain registrar Gname said that they are not responsible for content on the website. Hence, no one wants to do something for the crime. It seems all are sailing in the same boat to cheat innocent people. No one is ready to take any responsibility to put an end on these scams. all are united together in same mission to cheat innocent people.And also, whenever crypto is transferred from Legit apps then these legit apps block our accounts suspecting fraudulent activity but it never happens in your case. I have transferred cyrpto from your app to this fraud website m.enrollbank.com then it is smooth. It seems you support them and also they call themselves as secondary exchange."

And then they will tell you that they cannot pay you the profit because your wallet is not able to receive big amount such as $3500 and you have to pay to upgrade , and later they will tell you they cannot pay you again because you delayed the payment of upgrade and you need to pay more to unlock the profit."
