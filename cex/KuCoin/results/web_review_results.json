                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me! Also they blocked me in their telegram group once I started to claim there :("

Withdraws took about few hours and unfortunately missed some high opportunities for profit.Hope it will be changed and fixed"

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

When I returned to the order, it was closed and I couldn't approve my fiat money transferring. I contacted with merchant and she has approved she's got my money on her bank account. The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me! Also they blocked me in their telegram group once I started to claim there :("

                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me! Also they blocked me in their telegram group once I started to claim there :("

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

Performance problems with the app's interface are also a common complaint, pointing to a need for technical improvements to enhance stability and usability.

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

When I returned to the order, it was closed and I couldn't approve my fiat money transferring. I contacted with merchant and she has approved she's got my money on her bank account. The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

                "review": "I have been using KuCoin for a couple of year and thought they where a reliable marketplace, but unfortunately they are not.I did not login to my account for nearly a year during the bear market, but when I did I found that one of my main assets (FKX) were missing from my account. Apparently KuCoin decided to delist FKX, but did not feel the need to contact me about it to let me know. Instead they only made an announcement on their own website and after I did not withdrew my assets within their timespan, they claimed that I had forfeited the funds and took them for them selves. It would have taken just one text, email or phone call and I would have withdrawn the funds immediately. They know exactly how to reach you if they have a new listing or promotion, but when they decide to delist a token then they suddenly don't have your contact information available.I can only guess the reason behind this, but if you think of it than is does make a great business model to 'steal' the funds of the people that trusted you to safely hold them. Please be warned and watch out with whom you do business. There are more reliable marketplaces out there!#StaySafe #Frauds"

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

The support suggested to the merchant to send back fiat money to me, but merchant couldn't do this because of bank transaction restriction. The only way to solve this was to release crypto from her account to my. The merchant told that kucoin has internal ID for this type of transaction and that she already did such operation and it takes about 30 minutes. After that support asked the merchant to prepare certain USDT amount on her account and just disappeared! I've been waiting 3 days and nobody can tell me why it takes so long! Both of sides have agreement, the merchant account is blocked, crypto is frozen. The only thing they has to do \u2013 to send blocked crypto to me!

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

                "review": "For over 5 months, I've been caught in an exhausting loop trying to resolve what seemed like a simple issue with my account, which holds a substantial amount of USDT.Initially, I had faith in KuCoin's support system to promptly address and fix my problem. However, my situation has only become a testament to the painfully slow and ineffective customer service response.Each interaction with support has been met with prolonged delays, leaving me without access to my funds. Their communication strikes me as dismissive and lacking in urgency, as my repeated requests for escalation have gone unheeded. The irony of it all \u2013 the automated messages boast of a seamless support experience, yet my reality couldn't be further from that promise.The absence of a resolution and inaccessibility of my assets have led to mounting frustrations. It's hard not to feel that my funds are being held without justification, stirring a worrying notion that they may never intend to resolve the issue \u2013 almost as if they're willing to let my USDT slip through the cracks.In all seriousness, this ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I question the integrity of a service that can so easily disregard the concerns and rights of its users. The thought of my hard-earned money being cavalierly treated by KuCoin is unsettling, to say the least.To anyone considering KuCoin as their trading platform, I urge you to proceed with caution. The features and tools offered mean little if, in the end, access to your funds is compromised by inadequate customer support."

Again, 1 month passed when they answered. In this letter, only identification data was requested for the third time. I never get any other worthwhile answers.Update: I am now sure that they are playing with me on purpose. I send the data 2 days ago. Today I received an email again to send the data.

                "review": "I am writing this review to express my profound dissatisfaction with KuCoin Exchange. Despite being a KYC-verified user for over two years and a verified P2P merchant on the platform, KuCoin has unjustly frozen my funds and prevented me from making withdrawals. (ticket number: 4073423) KuCoin requested my identity documents even though my account has been verified for an extended period. Moreover, they demanded the source of my 3000 USDT deposit, which I had already explained as proceeds from selling my camera and receiving the payment in cryptocurrency. Despite providing this information, the support chat has been unresponsive and has refused to resolve the issue.From a legal perspective, KuCoin's actions raise serious concerns. According to international financial regulations and consumer protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 5, financial institutions are required to handle customer data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. KuCoin\u2019s arbitrary freezing of funds without adequate explanation or timely support violates these principles.Furthermore, under the principles of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which governs Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, customers who have completed KYC procedures should not face unwarranted obstructions in accessing their funds. KuCoin\u2019s insistence on additional documentation and refusal to address my case in a timely manner contravenes these standards.In summary, KuCoin\u2019s handling of my account has been deeply disappointing and legally questionable. I urge potential users to consider these issues before trusting their funds to this exchange."

                "review": "I am writing this review to express my profound dissatisfaction with KuCoin Exchange. Despite being a KYC-verified user for over two years and a verified P2P merchant on the platform, KuCoin has unjustly frozen my funds and prevented me from making withdrawals. (ticket number: 4073423) KuCoin requested my identity documents even though my account has been verified for an extended period. Moreover, they demanded the source of my 3000 USDT deposit, which I had already explained as proceeds from selling my camera and receiving the payment in cryptocurrency. Despite providing this information, the support chat has been unresponsive and has refused to resolve the issue.From a legal perspective, KuCoin's actions raise serious concerns. According to international financial regulations and consumer protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 5, financial institutions are required to handle customer data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. KuCoin\u2019s arbitrary freezing of funds without adequate explanation or timely support violates these principles.Furthermore, under the principles of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which governs Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, customers who have completed KYC procedures should not face unwarranted obstructions in accessing their funds. KuCoin\u2019s insistence on additional documentation and refusal to address my case in a timely manner contravenes these standards.In summary, KuCoin\u2019s handling of my account has been deeply disappointing and legally questionable. I urge potential users to consider these issues before trusting their funds to this exchange."

                "review": "I am writing this review to express my profound dissatisfaction with KuCoin Exchange. Despite being a KYC-verified user for over two years and a verified P2P merchant on the platform, KuCoin has unjustly frozen my funds and prevented me from making withdrawals. (ticket number: 4073423) KuCoin requested my identity documents even though my account has been verified for an extended period. Moreover, they demanded the source of my 3000 USDT deposit, which I had already explained as proceeds from selling my camera and receiving the payment in cryptocurrency. Despite providing this information, the support chat has been unresponsive and has refused to resolve the issue.From a legal perspective, KuCoin's actions raise serious concerns. According to international financial regulations and consumer protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 5, financial institutions are required to handle customer data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. KuCoin\u2019s arbitrary freezing of funds without adequate explanation or timely support violates these principles.Furthermore, under the principles of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which governs Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, customers who have completed KYC procedures should not face unwarranted obstructions in accessing their funds. KuCoin\u2019s insistence on additional documentation and refusal to address my case in a timely manner contravenes these standards.In summary, KuCoin\u2019s handling of my account has been deeply disappointing and legally questionable. I urge potential users to consider these issues before trusting their funds to this exchange."

Do they retain funds forever?If my situation is irregular or incomplete they must regularize it BEFORE receiving funds.

                "review": "I am writing this review to express my profound dissatisfaction with KuCoin Exchange. Despite being a KYC-verified user for over two years and a verified P2P merchant on the platform, KuCoin has unjustly frozen my funds and prevented me from making withdrawals. (ticket number: 4073423) KuCoin requested my identity documents even though my account has been verified for an extended period. Moreover, they demanded the source of my 3000 USDT deposit, which I had already explained as proceeds from selling my camera and receiving the payment in cryptocurrency. Despite providing this information, the support chat has been unresponsive and has refused to resolve the issue.From a legal perspective, KuCoin's actions raise serious concerns. According to international financial regulations and consumer protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 5, financial institutions are required to handle customer data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. KuCoin\u2019s arbitrary freezing of funds without adequate explanation or timely support violates these principles.Furthermore, under the principles of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which governs Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, customers who have completed KYC procedures should not face unwarranted obstructions in accessing their funds. KuCoin\u2019s insistence on additional documentation and refusal to address my case in a timely manner contravenes these standards.In summary, KuCoin\u2019s handling of my account has been deeply disappointing and legally questionable. I urge potential users to consider these issues before trusting their funds to this exchange."

                "review": "I am writing this review to express my profound dissatisfaction with KuCoin Exchange. Despite being a KYC-verified user for over two years and a verified P2P merchant on the platform, KuCoin has unjustly frozen my funds and prevented me from making withdrawals. (ticket number: 4073423) KuCoin requested my identity documents even though my account has been verified for an extended period. Moreover, they demanded the source of my 3000 USDT deposit, which I had already explained as proceeds from selling my camera and receiving the payment in cryptocurrency. Despite providing this information, the support chat has been unresponsive and has refused to resolve the issue.From a legal perspective, KuCoin's actions raise serious concerns. According to international financial regulations and consumer protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 5, financial institutions are required to handle customer data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. KuCoin\u2019s arbitrary freezing of funds without adequate explanation or timely support violates these principles.Furthermore, under the principles of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which governs Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, customers who have completed KYC procedures should not face unwarranted obstructions in accessing their funds. KuCoin\u2019s insistence on additional documentation and refusal to address my case in a timely manner contravenes these standards.In summary, KuCoin\u2019s handling of my account has been deeply disappointing and legally questionable. I urge potential users to consider these issues before trusting their funds to this exchange."

Do they retain funds forever?If my situation is irregular or incomplete they must regularize it BEFORE receiving funds.

Do they retain funds forever?If my situation is irregular or incomplete they must regularize it BEFORE receiving funds.

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me.

I repeated the sell trade a total of 3 times with each time being confirmed. The liquidation price NEVER changed. I got liquidated!! It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me.

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

What will happen if I cannot give them what they request? If they refuse my photo? Do they retain funds forever?If my situation is irregular or incomplete they must regularize it BEFORE receiving funds. After they receive funds, if something is missing, they can block new operations, BUT NOT WITHDRAWALS. THAT IS MY MONEY. They cannot sequestrate funds!!!!! Stay away!!!!"

What will happen if I cannot give them what they request? If they refuse my photo? Do they retain funds forever?If my situation is irregular or incomplete they must regularize it BEFORE receiving funds. After they receive funds, if something is missing, they can block new operations, BUT NOT WITHDRAWALS. THAT IS MY MONEY. They cannot sequestrate funds!!!!! Stay away!!!!"

Even with KYC, there was some issues with my account not showing verified when it was.  Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up.

They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me.

Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up.

They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me.

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

Even with KYC, there was some issues with my account not showing verified when it was.  Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me.

It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries.

I repeated the sell trade a total of 3 times with each time being confirmed. The liquidation price NEVER changed. I got liquidated!! It barely reached the price then of course the price immediately bounced back up. Ive been communication for weeks with customer service and they only say \" please send any screen shots you may have\"Who would have screen shots ??On every issue a person may have their only response is screen shots!! They say they cant see my trading history- thats a lie!!! On every transaction with an exchange , the exchange can do a forensic audit but customer service does not aknowledge this. They ALL repeat the same script. \"Screenshot\" They are either completely ignorant or willfully stupid or worse....My previous trade the price of xrp went to my liquidation price and bounced back up. I lost several thousand then but took the loss as part of doing leverage trading however this trade i did what i needed to to stay in the trade but kucoins platform screwed me. Customer service was and is unwilling to even consider any responsability!!!"

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the interplay between coins and blockchain is set to redefine financial systems and enhance global economic interactions.Please Visit website coinmedia.live"

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the interplay between coins and blockchain is set to redefine financial systems and enhance global economic interactions.Please Visit website coinmedia.live"

Even with KYC, there was some issues with my account not showing verified when it was.  Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

The conversation identified that differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities often pose significant roadblocks to successful public-private partnerships (PPPs). To address these challenges, it is essential to align expectations and develop a cohesive regulatory framework that facilitates collaboration. Further investigation could focus on creating standardized guidelines and fostering open communication channels to enhance trust and operational efficiency between stakeholders.",

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries.

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the interplay between coins and blockchain is set to redefine financial systems and enhance global economic interactions.Please Visit website coinmedia.live"

Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the interplay between coins and blockchain is set to redefine financial systems and enhance global economic interactions.Please Visit website coinmedia.live"

The conversations identified that roadblocks for public-private partnerships (PPPs) often arise from differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities. To address these challenges, fostering a shared understanding and aligning regulatory standards are crucial. Further investigation could focus on developing frameworks that facilitate smoother integration and collaboration between digital and traditional financial systems.",

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured through a distributed ledger system, where transactions are validated by a network of nodes, ensuring transparency and integrity. This innovative framework not only facilitates peer-to-peer transactions but also powers decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries.

I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

However, there is a call for more robust measures to prevent market manipulation tactics that could undermine these systems. Potential areas for improvement include enhancing regulatory frameworks and developing more sophisticated security protocols to protect against emerging threats in the crypto landscape.",

Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

Kucoin was nice enough to set my account to allow me full access until the issues were resolved on their side.Every time I have contacted support, I get a response within a few hours.  The site is very responsive and when it is not, they warn me ahead of time.  I know I am a small customer and don't have millions in my account, but they treat me like I do.Remember this is not yet available in the USA, its because of US regulations.  So don't knock them down because of this.I do love the bonuses they offer for trading.  They have spotted coupons from time to time to allow me to test my skills at trading.  They allowed me to keep the profits as the coupons expired.I do definitely recommend this trading platform, but do go slow if you are a beginner as there is lots to learn about trading...any questions, I am happy to answer...thanks...Stan..."

Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

                "review": "Kucoin customer acquisition is one of the biggest scams in the industry. Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

After transferring a significant amount of money, I realized that I had been scammed, and when I reached out to KuCoin for assistance, their response was shockingly unhelpful.Despite providing all relevant details and even involving law enforcement, KuCoin refused to cooperate or provide any support. They were unable or unwilling to help reverse the transactions, even though the funds were transferred to accounts linked to the scammers.What\u2019s most concerning is their lack of communication and failure to engage with the police or take any meaningful action. As a victim of fraud, I expected better protection, assistance, and cooperation, especially from a platform that handles substantial amounts of money.KuCoin\u2019s lack of transparency and unwillingness to help in cases of fraud makes it difficult to trust the platform moving forward. I strongly advise caution when using their services, especially when it comes to high-risk activities like cryptocurrency trading. In my case, they showed no regard for customer safety or fraud prevention, leaving me feeling unsupported and deeply frustrated.I would not recommend KuCoin to anyone looking for a secure and responsible platform."

Their operating logic is to list as many coins as possible that have social visibility, e.g. lots of Twitter followers. This listing means that the customer acquisition costs almost nothing because the followers are excited by the listing, transfer the coins to Kucoin and then naturally trade the coin. This makes it possible, and I'm sure many of you have done the same, to trade other coins as well. These listings come up almost every day, several a week. And every now and then, Kucoin at one time delists 10-20 or several dozen coins at once. When I started actively updating this process on Kucoin's Telegram page, quite matter-of-factly questioning the numerous listings and the huge number of delistings, Kucoin so typically on the spur of the moment banned me and did not want to have an open discussion about their methods. Anyone who follows Kucoin can draw the same conclusion."

After transferring a significant amount of money, I realized that I had been scammed, and when I reached out to KuCoin for assistance, their response was shockingly unhelpful.Despite providing all relevant details and even involving law enforcement, KuCoin refused to cooperate or provide any support. They were unable or unwilling to help reverse the transactions, even though the funds were transferred to accounts linked to the scammers.What\u2019s most concerning is their lack of communication and failure to engage with the police or take any meaningful action. As a victim of fraud, I expected better protection, assistance, and cooperation, especially from a platform that handles substantial amounts of money.KuCoin\u2019s lack of transparency and unwillingness to help in cases of fraud makes it difficult to trust the platform moving forward. I strongly advise caution when using their services, especially when it comes to high-risk activities like cryptocurrency trading. In my case, they showed no regard for customer safety or fraud prevention, leaving me feeling unsupported and deeply frustrated.I would not recommend KuCoin to anyone looking for a secure and responsible platform."

For blocking account for no reason and asking for many documents even tho I didn't do big transactions. I made some xmr deposits and they locked my withdrawals. Now few weeks and they request screenshots from wallet that these transactions were sent. It literally doesn't make sense.Avoid at all costs. There are better exchanges"

The people who answer the tickets are also dimwitted and answer you with unrelated and irresponsible responses."
