I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

For any compliance things, their quick fix is to freeze customer accounts. The management looks quite incompetent in handling account matters. Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day.

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have sent them all the information they require and every day I get the same message back it seems like I am dealing with a computer not a person. I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

Despite providing all the required documents for KYC verification, including an official bank statement with my full name, address, transaction history, and official stamps, my verification has been repeatedly rejected without specific explanations.I have spent countless hours trying to resolve this issue with OKX support, but my efforts have been in vain. My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have sent them all the information they require and every day I get the same message back it seems like I am dealing with a computer not a person. I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have email them every day because if you do not your case will be closed so you can guess how many emails I have sent. I have sent them all the information they require and every day I get the same message back it seems like I am dealing with a computer not a person. I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account.

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible.

Keep going in loops and sending me screenshots of their platforms interface?Do they expect me to put in 100.000 records daily?

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account.

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

Why? I have had no reply to that question. Just the usual computer generated BS.Has anyone had the same issue?I invite a human being from OKX to call me and talk me through the process.

For 3 months they make me jump through hoops uploading identification video's. they go silent for 48 hours only to close the case via email.Last week it even got worse it looks like they turned of their live support, when asking to speak with an operator 3 times in a row, they change the language setting and put you back to where you started, fighting with an automated bot.In 3 months time not 1 department was able to explain what happened and if my funds are safe. INstead they bother with stupid questions such as, can you use your f2a? Did you share your password with anybody. Its incredible frustrating. My life savings seem to be gone. As a result of not being able to use MY OWN FCKN money for 3 months i got kicked out of my house with my family. I am as broke as possible.If anybody wants to help me out to get my life back on track this is my wallet :0x37e6f475ba6033ea6fDd641Fc0541Ce5a4a436aFI lost 8000 usd from my hard earned life savings.Please consider well before signing up to OKX they are registered at the Seychelle Islands which basically means Go F youself as a customer in case something goes wrong like the case with me.Stay safe people and do not deposit what you can't afford to lose over at OKX.Okx shame on you for treating people this way, shame on you for making money in such a dodgy way. You effect lives with this scammy behavior and take 0.0 accountability beyond your agents feeling very sorry for the delay and all the hussle.Okx i say stay away from it, do yourself a favor i am pissed of for real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

For 3 months they make me jump through hoops uploading identification video's. they go silent for 48 hours only to close the case via email.Last week it even got worse it looks like they turned of their live support, when asking to speak with an operator 3 times in a row, they change the language setting and put you back to where you started, fighting with an automated bot.In 3 months time not 1 department was able to explain what happened and if my funds are safe. INstead they bother with stupid questions such as, can you use your f2a? Did you share your password with anybody. Its incredible frustrating. My life savings seem to be gone.As a result of not being able to use MY OWN money for 3 months i got kicked out of my house with my family. I am as broke as possible.I lost 8000 usd from my hard earned life savings.Please consider well before signing up to OKX they are registered at the Seychelle Islands which basically means Go F youself as a customer in case something goes wrong like the case with me.Stay safe people and do not deposit what you can't afford to lose over at OKX.Okx shame on you for treating people this way, shame on you for making money in such a dodgy way. You effect lives with this scammy behavior and take 0.0 accountability beyond your agents feeling very sorry for the delay and all the hussle.Okx i say stay away from it, do yourself a favor i am pissed of for real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.  Reading reviews on here, I can see I'm not the only one who has found funds frozen\\disappeared.My very short venture into crypto is at an end and I wish I'd never got involved in the first place."

Simplex - after 15 minutes wait time - they responded that their commissions are:Thank you for waiting. Our fees typically range from 3.5% to 5% of the total transaction value, with a minimum fee of $10 USD.\u200bFor your transaction of GBP 100.00, the following fees were applied:\u200bSimplex Fee: GBP 4.00=> not communicated prior to the transaction (I wish I could attach a screenshot to this transaction because it was still showing 133 USDT on checkout)....but 133 USDT vs 117 USDT is 15% less than what I should have received.First experience & never again:No transparent fees until the transaction is done. 15% less than what I should have received.I'm glad I haven't tried them on any bigger transactions..."

Simplex - after 15 minutes wait time - they responded that their commissions are:Thank you for waiting. Our fees typically range from 3.5% to 5% of the total transaction value, with a minimum fee of $10 USD.\u200bFor your transaction of GBP 100.00, the following fees were applied:\u200bSimplex Fee: GBP 4.00=> not communicated prior to the transaction (I wish I could attach a screenshot to this transaction because it was still showing 133 USDT on checkout)....but 133 USDT vs 117 USDT is 15% less than what I should have received.First experience & never again:No transparent fees until the transaction is done. 15% less than what I should have received.I'm glad I haven't tried them on any bigger transactions..."

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

Our fees typically range from 3.5% to 5% of the total transaction value, with a minimum fee of $10 USD.\u200bFor your transaction of GBP 100.00, the following fees were applied:\u200bSimplex Fee: GBP 4.00=> not communicated prior to the transaction (I wish I could attach a screenshot to this transaction because it was still showing 133 USDT on checkout)....but 133 USDT vs 117 USDT is 15% less than what I should have received.First experience & never again:No transparent fees until the transaction is done. 15% less than what I should have received.I'm glad I haven't tried them on any bigger transactions..."

This is a clear security concern and a direct violation of EU GDPR laws, and they insisted that this is what I needed to do. Of course, I rejected this and closed my account.

Their lack of transparency and accountability is appalling.OKX's inaction and disregard for customers' funds are clear signs of a scam. I urge everyone to avoid this exchange and take their business (and money) elsewhere.- Poor customer support- Unresponsive team- Scammed me out of $580- No transparency or accountability- Restrictive account policies*VERDICT:* OKX is a fraudulent exchange that prioritizes scamming customers over providing legitimate services.

Their support team wanted me to send them my ID and personal picture over email instead of fixing the issue on the platform! This is a clear security concern and a direct violation of EU GDPR laws, and they insisted that this is what I needed to do. Of course, I rejected this and closed my account.

Their lack of transparency and accountability is appalling.OKX's inaction and disregard for customers' funds are clear signs of a scam. I urge everyone to avoid this exchange and take their business (and money) elsewhere.- Poor customer support- Unresponsive team- Scammed me out of $580- No transparency or accountability- Restrictive account policies*VERDICT:* OKX is a fraudulent exchange that prioritizes scamming customers over providing legitimate services.

Our fees typically range from 3.5% to 5% of the total transaction value, with a minimum fee of $10 USD.\u200bFor your transaction of GBP 100.00, the following fees were applied:\u200bSimplex Fee: GBP 4.00=> not communicated prior to the transaction (I wish I could attach a screenshot to this transaction because it was still showing 133 USDT on checkout)....but 133 USDT vs 117 USDT is 15% less than what I should have received.First experience & never again:No transparent fees until the transaction is done. 15% less than what I should have received.I'm glad I haven't tried them on any bigger transactions..."

Their lack of transparency and accountability is appalling.OKX's inaction and disregard for customers' funds are clear signs of a scam. I urge everyone to avoid this exchange and take their business (and money) elsewhere.- Poor customer support- Unresponsive team- Scammed me out of $580- No transparency or accountability- Restrictive account policies*VERDICT:* OKX is a fraudulent exchange that prioritizes scamming customers over providing legitimate services.

Their lack of transparency and accountability is appalling.OKX's inaction and disregard for customers' funds are clear signs of a scam. I urge everyone to avoid this exchange and take their business (and money) elsewhere.- Poor customer support- Unresponsive team- Scammed me out of $580- No transparency or accountability- Restrictive account policies*VERDICT:* OKX is a fraudulent exchange that prioritizes scamming customers over providing legitimate services.

They scammed me out of $580 and have provided absolutely no help or resolution.I mistakenly sent funds to the exchange and reached out to their support team to lift the restriction on my account. However, the representative (who claimed to be assisting me) completely ignored my requests and failed to resolve the issue.It's been THREE DAYS with NO FEEDBACK, NO ACTION, and NO REFUND. Their lack of transparency and accountability is appalling.OKX's inaction and disregard for customers' funds are clear signs of a scam. I urge everyone to avoid this exchange and take their business (and money) elsewhere.- Poor customer support- Unresponsive team- Scammed me out of $580- No transparency or accountability- Restrictive account policies*VERDICT:* OKX is a fraudulent exchange that prioritizes scamming customers over providing legitimate services.

Integration between digital and traditional assets in global finance is a pivotal topic, emphasizing the need for mutual trust across the public-private spectrum to facilitate effective collaboration. The main roadblocks for public-private partnerships (PPPs) are identified as differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities. These challenges suggest a need for clearer regulatory guidelines and better alignment of expectations between public and private entities. Further investigation could focus on developing strategies to overcome these roadblocks and enhance the integration of digital and traditional financial assets.",

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay.

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay. Failure to address this immediately will result in me pursuing all possible legal actions and making sure your fraudulent actions are exposed to the public."

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay. Failure to address this immediately will result in me pursuing all possible legal actions and making sure your fraudulent actions are exposed to the public."

                "review": "I am a practicing attorney, and my initial experience with the OKX platform was quite positive. However, following a recent transaction, my account was suddenly restricted, and I was unable to make any withdrawals. A substantial amount of $180,311 was frozen in my account, and the platform didn\u2019t provide a clear reason for the restriction, which left me feeling quite confused and anxious.As a legal professional, I am familiar with compliance and review processes, so over the next three months, I proactively submitted all the documents requested by the platform to verify the legitimacy of my account. I also reached out to contacts in the platform\u2019s compliance department to help expedite the issue. It was an exhausting period, with numerous back-and-forth communications, most of which yielded slow progress.Fortunately, after repeatedly providing documentation and following up, my account was finally released after three months, and I was able to retrieve all my funds. This experience taught me a lot and made me realize how crucial strong customer support and transparent risk control processes are when choosing a platform. If you face a similar issue, feel free to reach out for assistance; my Telegram is:@DuxianshenFor other users, my advice is to ensure your personal identity and funds are legitimate, and if you encounter a similar situation, stay persistent, keep submitting documents, and consistently follow up. OKX still has room for improvement in its risk control processes, but I am thankful that my issue was eventually resolved."

To enhance user satisfaction, it is suggested that further investigation focus on developing more personalized content and improving service efficiency, particularly in resolving withdrawal and account access issues.",

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay. Failure to address this immediately will result in me pursuing all possible legal actions and making sure your fraudulent actions are exposed to the public."

                "review": "I am a practicing attorney, and my initial experience with the OKX platform was quite positive. However, following a recent transaction, my account was suddenly restricted, and I was unable to make any withdrawals. A substantial amount of $180,311 was frozen in my account, and the platform didn\u2019t provide a clear reason for the restriction, which left me feeling quite confused and anxious.As a legal professional, I am familiar with compliance and review processes, so over the next three months, I proactively submitted all the documents requested by the platform to verify the legitimacy of my account. I also reached out to contacts in the platform\u2019s compliance department to help expedite the issue. It was an exhausting period, with numerous back-and-forth communications, most of which yielded slow progress.Fortunately, after repeatedly providing documentation and following up, my account was finally released after three months, and I was able to retrieve all my funds. This experience taught me a lot and made me realize how crucial strong customer support and transparent risk control processes are when choosing a platform. If you face a similar issue, feel free to reach out for assistance; my Telegram is:@DuxianshenFor other users, my advice is to ensure your personal identity and funds are legitimate, and if you encounter a similar situation, stay persistent, keep submitting documents, and consistently follow up. OKX still has room for improvement in its risk control processes, but I am thankful that my issue was eventually resolved."

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay. Failure to address this immediately will result in me pursuing all possible legal actions and making sure your fraudulent actions are exposed to the public."

However, following a recent transaction, my account was suddenly restricted, and I was unable to make any withdrawals. A substantial amount of $180,311 was frozen in my account, and the platform didn\u2019t provide a clear reason for the restriction, which left me feeling quite confused and anxious.As a legal professional, I am familiar with compliance and review processes, so over the next three months, I proactively submitted all the documents requested by the platform to verify the legitimacy of my account. I also reached out to contacts in the platform\u2019s compliance department to help expedite the issue. It was an exhausting period, with numerous back-and-forth communications, most of which yielded slow progress.Fortunately, after repeatedly providing documentation and following up, my account was finally released after three months, and I was able to retrieve all my funds. This experience taught me a lot and made me realize how crucial strong customer support and transparent risk control processes are when choosing a platform. If you face a similar issue, feel free to reach out for assistance; my Telegram is:@DuxianshenFor other users, my advice is to ensure your personal identity and funds are legitimate, and if you encounter a similar situation, stay persistent, keep submitting documents, and consistently follow up. OKX still has room for improvement in its risk control processes, but I am thankful that my issue was eventually resolved."

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay. Failure to address this immediately will result in me pursuing all possible legal actions and making sure your fraudulent actions are exposed to the public."

However, following a recent transaction, my account was suddenly restricted, and I was unable to make any withdrawals. A substantial amount of $180,311 was frozen in my account, and the platform didn\u2019t provide a clear reason for the restriction, which left me feeling quite confused and anxious.As a legal professional, I am familiar with compliance and review processes, so over the next three months, I proactively submitted all the documents requested by the platform to verify the legitimacy of my account. I also reached out to contacts in the platform\u2019s compliance department to help expedite the issue. It was an exhausting period, with numerous back-and-forth communications, most of which yielded slow progress.Fortunately, after repeatedly providing documentation and following up, my account was finally released after three months, and I was able to retrieve all my funds. This experience taught me a lot and made me realize how crucial strong customer support and transparent risk control processes are when choosing a platform. If you face a similar issue, feel free to reach out for assistance; my Telegram is:@DuxianshenFor other users, my advice is to ensure your personal identity and funds are legitimate, and if you encounter a similar situation, stay persistent, keep submitting documents, and consistently follow up. OKX still has room for improvement in its risk control processes, but I am thankful that my issue was eventually resolved."

It has been more than 60 business days, the timeframe you initially provided, and yet no action has been taken to resolve the situation. This prolonged inaction makes it abundantly clear that OKX is deliberately withholding my funds without any valid reason, which amounts to nothing less than theft and fraud.My account has been active for two years without any issues, and my only interactions on your platform have been with close family and friends. Despite this, you have frozen my account without providing any legitimate explanation, and I believe this is a clear abuse of power and misuse of my assets.If this matter is not resolved immediately, I will take it upon myself to publicly expose OKX's actions as fraudulent behavior. I will ensure that this message is widely shared so others are fully aware of the risks of entrusting OKX with their funds.This situation is absolutely unacceptable, and I demand that my account be reinstated without further delay. Failure to address this immediately will result in me pursuing all possible legal actions and making sure your fraudulent actions are exposed to the public."

                "review": "OKX Review: A Shady Scam Operation Disguised as an ExchangeAs a high-volume trader on OKX for over six years, I never expected to be treated like this. When OKX removed my local currency support, so I have been using an external fiat gateway for over a year, it was a whitelisted withdrawal address in my account. Then one day this fiat gateway had been sanctioned by the U.S. which I was not aware about. After withdrawing a mere $1,000\u2014an insignificant amount relative to my overall balance\u2014OKX suspended my entire account. Not even elaborating a bit or warning that one of the addresses on my white list is now sanctioned. They literally wanted me to use it. What followed was an exhausting ordeal. For over 50 days their support was simply copy/pasting the same message \u201cwait, we don\u2019t know how long, we can\u2019t say why your funds are blocked (at first I was not aware of the sanctions and had to figure it out myself)\u201d. After 50 days, dozens of emails and public complaints in their community, they finally allowed me to withdraw my funds\u2014but not all of them. They held onto the $1,000 and kept it for themselves without any valid justification.To put things in perspective, I had the exact same issue on Bitget. Bitget resolved the issue in under six days, releasing all my funds and keeping nothing. They handled the situation with transparency and respect for their users.OKX, on the other hand, is run by the shadiest bunch of scammers. They took advantage of regulatory issues to enrich themselves under the pretense of \u201cfollowing the law.\u201d Instead of handling things professionally, they exploited the situation to seize my funds and refused to give a clear reason for keeping my money.For anyone considering using OKX, think twice. There are reputable exchanges out there that treat customers with integrity. OKX, unfortunately, is not one of them. Withdraw all your funds from OKX asap."

The inconsistency in service quality suggests a need for the company to address these trust and reliability concerns to improve overall customer satisfaction. Further investigation into the root causes of these polarized experiences and implementing transparent practices could enhance trust and service consistency.",

All's well until I came to withdraw, only then finding my account frozen. Having contacted OKF, I was told they now felt my initial investment could have come from an illegal source and I had to verify my deposits, but not the initial deposit, I have to deposit a further amount, 25% of my current holdings. I do not have that amount anywhere. When explained to OKF, their response was,\" Then your account will remain frozen\".Total scam to ensure I cannot withdraw funds. If they have concerns about my initail deposit, then ask me to verify them.You will not get your money back!!! Keep away!!"

Until now all you have been replying is that you will update me in 24hrs and 48hrs over 7 day's now. Going through previous reviews of people here is enough to say that okx is just designed to scam and frustrate people life hiding under the trend of crypto currency. Because I can't see how I will bring my hard earned money to okx exchange only for me to use it and buy there products and they went ahead to trapped my money, logged me out of there system. I called on trustpilot platform to do justice by coming in to this case if really you still keep to your goals as a mediator between customer and business owners. So that I can recover my money which is about $4500 as at the time this account was frozen. The money in question is my hard earned money with proof. Okx should save me this stress. And looking at all this negative reviews, if my case continues to linger. Guy I'm going to drop my details here for us to form a team to bring this okx exchange app down from play store etc. With my team of lawyers, I'm going to lead the way. Let us drag this company to proof there integrity in business space.Because your can not just open a platform and be using it to frustrate people's life. My entire November hard earned is my funds that was trapped in okx and other funds I had in  product's they said to be selling as my investments. Mother banks here in Europe we simply ask for another account details to send you your funds if they see that customer goes against there terms and conditions but okx the reverse is the case and it can't continue."

He has been saying that I must pay for verification payments to release my profits. I paid the first one and got an excuse of this new additional payment that has to be made. I asked for a refund for my funds and he refused,I asked him what happened to the group he posts on and went quiet,the group has since been deleted for it's false advertising. I read several reviews about him being a scammer, please advise If the company has this investor with them."
