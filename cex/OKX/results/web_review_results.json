I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I contacted the FCA and Action Fraud who confirmed my suspicions. the names to look out for our Anthony, Lucy White and Lucas Graf Claims to be OKX. I would advise anybody against crypto companies or people claiming to get your money back they are all fraudsters. SMM limited have now taken down there website (What a Surprise) I have only lost a small amount but I have now met people or spoken to them who have lost over \u00a350000 and I mean well over. The strange thing is okx don't even have a phone number that you can contact and how can they be the 3rd main sponsor of Manchester City. Please be warned."

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

For any compliance things, their quick fix is to freeze customer accounts. The management looks quite incompetent in handling account matters. Don\u2019t think they understand what it means to freeze someone\u2019s account without written notices and warnings. Their parent company already verified me before and now with Aussie migration they are re-verifying everyone in Australia with an excuse that\u2019s its regulatory requirement. Why couldn\u2019t do pre-migration! Incompetence at its heights. Don\u2019t waste you time. This exchange will surprise you!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Maybe because they got hacked a few months ago?I can't use their QR-Code link for renewal of the verification, since I do not have a smartphone. I could open up an account and fund it - without smartphone, but now, I can't renew verification anymore without a smartphone?They do no longer accept verification by email or computer. But even when friends help out with a smartphone, OKX system does not work either. I only get error messages like: \"verfication failed\" or \"selfie does not match passport\". I had more than twenty failed  attempts to do the verfication that way. Customer support first promised to send me a specified jumio email link for verification, but then they withdrew and just emailed me: \"Try again\". This is no support, this is customer mobbing!"

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

Okx said l had deposited more than my \u00a35000 allowed so l needed to pay 10% of the deposit to verify it. They said my deposit plus the 10% would be refunded after verification within 2-3 hours. Because this was \u00a33000+ l could   not do it but the ft-trader so called financial adviser said he would sort it. He asked me for \u00a3400 and guess what he has now dissappeared along with all my money. How did OKX allow my funds to be withdrawn without my say so when they stipulated that the 10% had to come from a bank bearing an account in my name!!! I am nearly 82 and before you say it l know l have been scammed but OKX released my funds without my permission and all l get is an automated bot telling me l have not signed in.

I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day.

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have sent them all the information they require and every day I get the same message back it seems like I am dealing with a computer not a person. I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

Despite providing all the required documents for KYC verification, including an official bank statement with my full name, address, transaction history, and official stamps, my verification has been repeatedly rejected without specific explanations.I have spent countless hours trying to resolve this issue with OKX support, but my efforts have been in vain. My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have sent them all the information they require and every day I get the same message back it seems like I am dealing with a computer not a person. I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

My requests are met with automated responses, and the support team fails to provide any clear guidance or assistance. This lack of communication and transparency has led to severe personal and financial difficulties.It seems that my situation is not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences where their funds were suddenly blocked, and no documents were accepted. This raises serious concerns about the integrity and reliability of OKX as a platform.I am left with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks of using OKX. If you value your funds and want a platform that provides responsive and transparent support, I strongly advise considering other options."

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

I have email them every day because if you do not your case will be closed so you can guess how many emails I have sent. I have sent them all the information they require and every day I get the same message back it seems like I am dealing with a computer not a person. I have lost 54,000 pounds and I am a pension and I want the money. The broker who was dealing with my money does not work for the company he told me he is independent yet he is on their webpage dealing with customers. I think he lives in Pakistan and every email I have sent and given person has been replying not the same one every day. And I think the company is registered in the Seychelles which means the shareholders are not responsible for anything so if you want to lose your money you better off going straight to a scammer because it is a less hassle"

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account.

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible.

Keep going in loops and sending me screenshots of their platforms interface?Do they expect me to put in 100.000 records daily?

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account.

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

They asked me for all the proofs, which I provided and then they just simply said they could not do anything that I should report the case to the police, thing that I did before even contacting them.Now I receive an email from OKX, 8 months after I reported my case of being scammed, and they inform me that they are closing my okx account for breaking their rules, when i havent made any transactions since the scamming situation. They blocked my account and do not allow me to convert my assest to transfer them to my bank account. So they are basically  telling me : F*** YOU!I did not do anything wrong, I reported I was being scammed and this lovely poeple, instead of helping me they also rob me!!F**** incredible. Customer service only reply with templates, they do not read the information and they do not share any empathy. worse service ever and thieves!!Run away from this wallet!!"

Why? I have had no reply to that question. Just the usual computer generated BS.Has anyone had the same issue?I invite a human being from OKX to call me and talk me through the process.

For 3 months they make me jump through hoops uploading identification video's. they go silent for 48 hours only to close the case via email.Last week it even got worse it looks like they turned of their live support, when asking to speak with an operator 3 times in a row, they change the language setting and put you back to where you started, fighting with an automated bot.In 3 months time not 1 department was able to explain what happened and if my funds are safe. INstead they bother with stupid questions such as, can you use your f2a? Did you share your password with anybody. Its incredible frustrating. My life savings seem to be gone. As a result of not being able to use MY OWN FCKN money for 3 months i got kicked out of my house with my family. I am as broke as possible.If anybody wants to help me out to get my life back on track this is my wallet :0x37e6f475ba6033ea6fDd641Fc0541Ce5a4a436aFI lost 8000 usd from my hard earned life savings.Please consider well before signing up to OKX they are registered at the Seychelle Islands which basically means Go F youself as a customer in case something goes wrong like the case with me.Stay safe people and do not deposit what you can't afford to lose over at OKX.Okx shame on you for treating people this way, shame on you for making money in such a dodgy way. You effect lives with this scammy behavior and take 0.0 accountability beyond your agents feeling very sorry for the delay and all the hussle.Okx i say stay away from it, do yourself a favor i am pissed of for real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

For 3 months they make me jump through hoops uploading identification video's. they go silent for 48 hours only to close the case via email.Last week it even got worse it looks like they turned of their live support, when asking to speak with an operator 3 times in a row, they change the language setting and put you back to where you started, fighting with an automated bot.In 3 months time not 1 department was able to explain what happened and if my funds are safe. INstead they bother with stupid questions such as, can you use your f2a? Did you share your password with anybody. Its incredible frustrating. My life savings seem to be gone.As a result of not being able to use MY OWN money for 3 months i got kicked out of my house with my family. I am as broke as possible.I lost 8000 usd from my hard earned life savings.Please consider well before signing up to OKX they are registered at the Seychelle Islands which basically means Go F youself as a customer in case something goes wrong like the case with me.Stay safe people and do not deposit what you can't afford to lose over at OKX.Okx shame on you for treating people this way, shame on you for making money in such a dodgy way. You effect lives with this scammy behavior and take 0.0 accountability beyond your agents feeling very sorry for the delay and all the hussle.Okx i say stay away from it, do yourself a favor i am pissed of for real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.

Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.  Reading reviews on here, I can see I'm not the only one who has found funds frozen\\disappeared.My very short venture into crypto is at an end and I wish I'd never got involved in the first place."

                "review": "Complete newbie to crypto.  Deposited 50 into OKX wallet as test run from my trading account, requested withdrawal and all was well.  Then deposited 1850 into OKX wallet, this being my total trading funds.  Received email saying I had to complete further verification by proving money movement management.... I had to deposit \u00a35k into OKX wallet, they would verify it then would release my frozen funds of 1850 and I could then withdraw my money.Replied to the email stating I didn't understand.  Almost immediate phone call from 'someone' saying basically if I don't deposit \u00a35k by end of week (2 days away), I will lose my money.  She even suggested I consider taking out a loan to be able to fulfil the deposit request!I will not be giving them 5k and I know my crypto has been swallowed up by them.  Reading reviews on here, I can see I'm not the only one who has found funds frozen\\disappeared.My very short venture into crypto is at an end and I wish I'd never got involved in the first place."
