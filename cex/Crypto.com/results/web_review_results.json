The whole system works around holding of CRO and they use that token to cash out to pay for marketing and internal costs. My CRO went from A$1 to $0.10 and during the crypto recovery when bitcoin went ATH the CRO token barely whimpered as they cashed in. These are the worst group of people in the Crypto industry yet to be prosecuted. Dont. DONT DONT!! use this platform. I am not against Crypto but these people are snakes by any other name."

It's kind of clunky and not that intuitive or streamlined.  It's certainly not pretty.  But it worked for me.  Also, compared to other platforms...I thought the fees were alright. I will use the platform again."

After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning.

No matter how many times I tried, It kept saying \"network error, please try again.\" Everything else in the app was live and well so it definitely was NOT a network problem. Is it a coincidence that just when I was making good money that all of a sudden we have network errors that wouldn't let me sell the contract? I cleared the app's cache, restarted it, nothing worked. Eventually, after an hour or two, the contract went the other way until it was blown up and I went from nice profits to very ugly losses. These kinds of things should NEVER happen on a trading platform! So far they didn't bother to respond to my email about the incident, but I smell fraud from miles away. I lost trust in them."

Then they told me to buy their card and use the money. Their must be made by AI. Artificial Imbeciles. Who will tell their client to spend their money in order to have it back? So the other imbecile here did what they told. So, all of a sudden they decided to freeze my card. I went to the app to try to unfreeze it and the app told me to get in touch. Again, how can an institution be so incompetent? I opened the chat and after a while I talked to someone who resembled a human being. After explaining my case 3 times she or he or they or ze told me to call a specialist. Wait. Who was I talking to then? A trained monkey?So here I am, two hours later waiting for someone with half a brain to solve my MISTERY OF THE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNFREEZE CARRRDDD."

My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

After many days of silence I have to recontact them, with the same epilogue. That happened many times.I have found big security issues. My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

What caught me off guard was that you could not sell direct to a wallet and could only transfer to another crypto currency (which results in fees) by default. After working with support for several weeks, they claimed this on a caching issue, I finally got an agent that said I needed to set up my currency for this \"fiat wallet' and even though I had set my currency when I setup my account, I needed to do it again in this fiat wallet or it wasn't even selectable during the sell crypto process. This process by the way, was also difficult to get started. This resulted in mistakes trying to sell into other crypto currency for them to collect more fees. Why not just call it a wallet or \"my cash\" and why hide it also behind a name like fiat wallet. Additionally why block it behind another verification of funds to use when I had already chosen my default currency when I signed up.Extracting money from this \"fiat wallet\" is also a chore hidden behind a shady process. Turns out you also need to DEPOSIT money into this Fiat Wallet for it to be able to withdrawl on first use. S9 not only haveI already deposited money so you know where it came from, you make me do it AGAIN. On top of that, I deposited the min allowed to get it going ($20) and THEN found out you cannot withdrawl unless you are withdrawing at least $100. So I needed to deposit even more money to take it all back (with a fee of course).While Crypto functions may work, the business practices of the company in these examples was enough for me not to trust this company. Add to that it took weeks of back and forth just to get my 'fiat wallet' issue looked at, stay clear."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

What caught me off guard was that you could not sell direct to a wallet and could only transfer to another crypto currency (which results in fees) by default. After working with support for several weeks, they claimed this on a caching issue, I finally got an agent that said I needed to set up my currency for this \"fiat wallet' and even though I had set my currency when I setup my account, I needed to do it again in this fiat wallet or it wasn't even selectable during the sell crypto process. This process by the way, was also difficult to get started. This resulted in mistakes trying to sell into other crypto currency for them to collect more fees. Why not just call it a wallet or \"my cash\" and why hide it also behind a name like fiat wallet. Additionally why block it behind another verification of funds to use when I had already chosen my default currency when I signed up.Extracting money from this \"fiat wallet\" is also a chore hidden behind a shady process. Turns out you also need to DEPOSIT money into this Fiat Wallet for it to be able to withdrawl on first use. S9 not only haveI already deposited money so you know where it came from, you make me do it AGAIN. On top of that, I deposited the min allowed to get it going ($20) and THEN found out you cannot withdrawl unless you are withdrawing at least $100. So I needed to deposit even more money to take it all back (with a fee of course).While Crypto functions may work, the business practices of the company in these examples was enough for me not to trust this company. Add to that it took weeks of back and forth just to get my 'fiat wallet' issue looked at, stay clear."

While the security features and user-friendly interface are praised, these positives are overshadowed by the negative experiences of many users. Critical issues seem to center on functionality, particularly with account access, which is a fundamental aspect of user experience. The poor performance of the interface suggests a need for technical improvements to enhance stability and usability. To address these concerns and improve overall satisfaction, the app developers should prioritize enhancing customer support, refining the interface, and ensuring reliable account access.",

They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

                "review": "I've used this for almost a year now, and had no real issues.. both with using my crypto card (have had two different cards) and with sending funds to other wallets. im sure many of the issues mentioned here are real, and clearly they need to invest in (human) customer support- but details like network fees (just stick with Solana), gas fees, lockup times, the importance of correct chain choice between wallets - there are online tutorials, and prices are mentioned in the terms and other places online, it's not unique to cryptocom, it's not a scam, it's a business model. but some of you seem to be complaining about real scams, \"first you call me and sell me this app, with too many adds and then you took my money\" doesn't sound like the actual crypto.com. fees aren't scams, the one you just paid made some graph jump, that's pretty much the game. Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

                "review": "This by far has got to be the worst Absolutely terrible experience with this crypto app. They market it as a versatile Visa card you can use anywhere, but that's far from the truth. They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

                "review": "I've used this for almost a year now, and had no real issues.. both with using my crypto card (have had two different cards) and with sending funds to other wallets. im sure many of the issues mentioned here are real, and clearly they need to invest in (human) customer support- but details like network fees (just stick with Solana), gas fees, lockup times, the importance of correct chain choice between wallets - there are online tutorials, and prices are mentioned in the terms and other places online, it's not unique to cryptocom, it's not a scam, it's a business model. but some of you seem to be complaining about real scams, \"first you call me and sell me this app, with too many adds and then you took my money\" doesn't sound like the actual crypto.com. fees aren't scams, the one you just paid made some graph jump, that's pretty much the game. Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

After well over a week working with customer service they offered to move the funds via wire transfer to my bank.  That was 5 days ago and the wire transfer has still not occurred.  I keep raising it to customer service and they keep telling me to be patient.  They are seizing my funds and not allowing me access to the funds and refuse to resolve the issue.   I wish someone would form a class action suit against them so that everyone who has been screwed by them can join it and get damages for illegally seizing funds and holding them in Crypto and refusing to release the funds back to the rightful owners"

You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there.

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing. I would caution others to think twice before using Crypto.com, as my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare."

I got locked out of my Amazon account and was asked to provide my crypto.com card statement with my address and card number... It's been almost 3 days, and crypto.com support (wether via app or X) is unable to produce one. I also had to explain 4 times what is it I need. Still nothing. Something that should be easily available through the app is impossible to achieve in any way so far. You can get a transaction history as csv, which in my case is useless. Still their support was trying to push me there. 2 days back was the last time I heard from them. Thanking me for my patience and explaining they \"don't have a timeline\" to provide a card statement... Glad I didn't upgrade my card. It's good when it's working, you are on your own when it doesn't."

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.  Wire transfers take 1 - 2 days, and though you can\u2019t trade with those funds, once they arrive, you can, and you can withdraw whatever crypto you buy with wired funds immediately.

Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing.

Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing.

Days later I got tired of holding the coin so I just wanted to withdraw and do something else with my money.

I just click convert and I just see \u00a385 left. \u00a310 loss. Unbelievable. I convert from BTC to GBP and I see \u00a383 left. To withdraw it's a \u00a31.90 fee.

Over the past several months, I have transacted thousands of dollars through the Crypto.com app, paying significant fees in the process. Since December 2023, I have been trying to receive a refund for a transaction issue, and now, at the end of May 2024, my account is still frozen. Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing. I would caution others to think twice before using Crypto.com, as my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare."

Over the past several months, I have transacted thousands of dollars through the Crypto.com app, paying significant fees in the process. Since December 2023, I have been trying to receive a refund for a transaction issue, and now, at the end of May 2024, my account is still frozen. Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing. I would caution others to think twice before using Crypto.com, as my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare."

I've had issues with my own bank not allowing transfers into my account, but that's not due to crypto.com.  I'm from the UK, so banks can be quite strict.  I've never used the defi app, so I can't comment on that.  I've also never had to contact customer support, so I can't comment on that either.The app can occasionally be slow, I've noticed that after some updates it has been a bit laggy, but at the moment there are no issues.  They offer a large range of tokens and a number of staking options.  The prices on here are higher than other exchanges as that's how they make their fees, unlike others that charge you a specific amount when you buy.Overall, I'm happy with the service and this exchange.  I also have their metal debit card, which I use all the time."

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.

I misunderstood something about deposits of FIAT currency, that ACH deposits, though you\u2019re able to trade with the funds immediately, have to be settle, and that takes 5 - 7 business days. The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.  Wire transfers take 1 - 2 days, and though you can\u2019t trade with those funds, once they arrive, you can, and you can withdraw whatever crypto you buy with wired funds immediately.

They have caused serious inconvenience and as you try explain this to them, they do not care. Definely use other platforms if you want to incvest in crypto. Stay far far away from Crypto.com and if you have an account with them, close it and open a Revolut account or something. Avoid by all cost for your peace of mind."

The single review dated June 06, 2024, with a 5-star rating, highlights confusion over mixed feedback, indicating overall satisfaction but pointing to inconsistencies in user experiences. Positive reviews generally praise the platform's service features, while negative reviews criticize its legal and operational aspects. The key findings suggest a need for better regulatory compliance and clearer communication to address user concerns. Further investigation should focus on understanding the regulatory landscape and improving institutional adoption to enhance overall user satisfaction.",

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore.

Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money.

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money.

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026.

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

A few weeks ago, i withdrew $100 worth of bitcoin. Upon checking the confirmation, i realized they took $56 out of my $100 withdrawal. Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

However, significant dissatisfaction stems from regulatory ambiguity, unmet investor expectations, poor customer service, high commissions, and frequent spam emails. The critical issues revolve around the lack of regulatory clarity and the failure to meet investor priorities, which overshadow the positive aspects of governance and community involvement. To improve, the company should focus on enhancing regulatory transparency, addressing investor concerns more effectively, and improving customer service responsiveness. Further investigation into reducing high commissions and minimizing spam emails could also help in addressing user dissatisfaction.",

There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026.

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

A few weeks ago, i withdrew $100 worth of bitcoin. Upon checking the confirmation, i realized they took $56 out of my $100 withdrawal. Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

Positive aspects include efficient processes, robust security, and speed, with users appreciating the coherent language and specific, informed content in governance and technical updates. However, critical issues such as poor customer service, high commissions, email spams, and P2P service problems are frequently mentioned. Negative reviews often point to repetitive patterns and generic phrasing, indicating a need for more transparency and personalized communication. To improve, addressing customer service concerns, reducing commissions, and minimizing email spams could enhance user satisfaction, while further investigation into P2P issues and content quality could provide deeper insights for refinement.",

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

A few weeks ago, i withdrew $100 worth of bitcoin. Upon checking the confirmation, i realized they took $56 out of my $100 withdrawal. Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money.

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

I then tried to fund my account with an ATM card it kept getting rejected my credit card was rejected. There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026. I tried cash app and had immediate success and now use them to buy cryptocurrency\u2019s"

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.  Wire transfers take 1 - 2 days, and though you can\u2019t trade with those funds, once they arrive, you can, and you can withdraw whatever crypto you buy with wired funds immediately.

I contacted their customer support to try and get the issue resolved. I got connected to one of their \u201eSpecialists\u201c who are NOT specialists at all. They first said it was a problem with the one time password (I don\u2019t have one time password active) but I went along anyway since I thought the must know. It took them TREE days to deactivate the OTP and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. They then said it was cause I wasn\u2019t using the passkey feature on IOS I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t). At this point it has been FIVE DAYS since I contacted their support. I gave up at this point. I\u2018m switching to a different exchange and I don\u2019t recommend anyone uses Crypto.com.

I then tried to fund my account with an ATM card it kept getting rejected my credit card was rejected. There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026. I tried cash app and had immediate success and now use them to buy cryptocurrency\u2019s"

I\u2018ve been using Crypto.com since 2020 and I\u2018ve had no issues until I got locked out of my account because I was trying to log in from a different country. I contacted their customer support to try and get the issue resolved. I got connected to one of their \u201eSpecialists\u201c who are NOT specialists at all. They first said it was a problem with the one time password (I don\u2019t have one time password active) but I went along anyway since I thought the must know. It took them TREE days to deactivate the OTP and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. They then said it was cause I wasn\u2019t using the passkey feature on IOS I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t). At this point it has been FIVE DAYS since I contacted their support. I gave up at this point. I\u2018m switching to a different exchange and I don\u2019t recommend anyone uses Crypto.com. Its great until you have an issue and their customer support won\u2019t help you in any way.

I contacted their customer support to try and get the issue resolved. I got connected to one of their \u201eSpecialists\u201c who are NOT specialists at all. They first said it was a problem with the one time password (I don\u2019t have one time password active) but I went along anyway since I thought the must know. It took them TREE days to deactivate the OTP and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. They then said it was cause I wasn\u2019t using the passkey feature on IOS I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t). At this point it has been FIVE DAYS since I contacted their support. I gave up at this point. I\u2018m switching to a different exchange and I don\u2019t recommend anyone uses Crypto.com.

I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t).

Positive feedback often centers on technological advancements, market growth, and the reliability of stablecoins, indicating satisfaction with innovation and financial stability. However, negative reviews point to challenges in blockchain adoption, market volatility, and concerns over stablecoin security, suggesting areas where implementation and financial risk management need improvement. The discussions reveal growing investor confidence, bolstered by increased blockchain adoption and stablecoin transactions, with minimal concerns about market manipulation. To further enhance the market, efforts could focus on addressing adoption barriers, mitigating volatility, and strengthening the security of stablecoins.",

However, about 2 weeks after coming back I am suddenly informed that my account has been terminated effective immediately due to \"A recent review of your Crypto.com account having revealed that your account activities do not meet our requirements for user conduct\". I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

Their excuse is that they use the lowest rate the currency was at within the last 24 hours. So if your investment jumps 1000% and you want to sell, you will only get -1000% back. How is anyone supposed to make a profit. In the end, I had invested in 8 different crypto currencies and all where in the green. I sold everything to move my account over to Wealth simple instead and not only did I not get any profit which should have been over 10% of my initial investment but I lost roughly 5% of my own money.

Their excuse is that they use the lowest rate the currency was at within the last 24 hours. So if your investment jumps 1000% and you want to sell, you will only get -1000% back. How is anyone supposed to make a profit. In the end, I had invested in 8 different crypto currencies and all where in the green. I sold everything to move my account over to Wealth simple instead and not only did I not get any profit which should have been over 10% of my initial investment but I lost roughly 5% of my own money.

For example, I had a profit of 10% on one of my big investments. When I tried to sell it, not only did I not get my 10% profit but they also took another 4% of my investment from me. Their excuse is that they use the lowest rate the currency was at within the last 24 hours. So if your investment jumps 1000% and you want to sell, you will only get -1000% back. How is anyone supposed to make a profit. In the end, I had invested in 8 different crypto currencies and all where in the green. I sold everything to move my account over to Wealth simple instead and not only did I not get any profit which should have been over 10% of my initial investment but I lost roughly 5% of my own money.

I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next?

I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next?

I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next?

They've had it for two or three years. I can't make changes because they have NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. In my opinion, they are a flim-fam scam outfit. They have it fixed so that when your money held with them reaches a certain low point (I think it's under $100 or something. I can't recall the exact amount. But when that happens, you can not take out your money. You can not take out under $100 of your own money. Therefore, you can't close your account. All this can (and I'm not saying it will or won't or giving advice) mess up your income tax. I really think what they do is against the law and they should be sued and charged. I've been out of crypto for about three years but can't close this account. My money belongs to them. Please, if you deal in crypto, do business with a reputable place. None of them are great but I think coinbase may be as close to honest as any of them. Crypto.com is very bad."

I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.

However, about 2 weeks after coming back I am suddenly informed that my account has been terminated effective immediately due to \"A recent review of your Crypto.com account having revealed that your account activities do not meet our requirements for user conduct\". I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

They have it fixed so that when your money held with them reaches a certain low point (I think it's under $100 or something. I can't recall the exact amount. But when that happens, you can not take out your money. You can not take out under $100 of your own money. Therefore, you can't close your account. All this can (and I'm not saying it will or won't or giving advice) mess up your income tax. I really think what they do is against the law and they should be sued and charged. I've been out of crypto for about three years but can't close this account. My money belongs to them. Please, if you deal in crypto, do business with a reputable place. None of them are great but I think coinbase may be as close to honest as any of them. Crypto.com is very bad."

However, about 2 weeks after coming back I am suddenly informed that my account has been terminated effective immediately due to \"A recent review of your Crypto.com account having revealed that your account activities do not meet our requirements for user conduct\". I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

They have it fixed so that when your money held with them reaches a certain low point (I think it's under $100 or something. I can't recall the exact amount. But when that happens, you can not take out your money. You can not take out under $100 of your own money. Therefore, you can't close your account. All this can (and I'm not saying it will or won't or giving advice) mess up your income tax. I really think what they do is against the law and they should be sued and charged. I've been out of crypto for about three years but can't close this account. My money belongs to them. Please, if you deal in crypto, do business with a reputable place. None of them are great but I think coinbase may be as close to honest as any of them. Crypto.com is very bad."

They've had it for two or three years. I can't make changes because they have NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. In my opinion, they are a flim-fam scam outfit. They have it fixed so that when your money held with them reaches a certain low point (I think it's under $100 or something. I can't recall the exact amount. But when that happens, you can not take out your money. You can not take out under $100 of your own money. Therefore, you can't close your account. All this can (and I'm not saying it will or won't or giving advice) mess up your income tax. I really think what they do is against the law and they should be sued and charged. I've been out of crypto for about three years but can't close this account. My money belongs to them. Please, if you deal in crypto, do business with a reputable place. None of them are great but I think coinbase may be as close to honest as any of them. Crypto.com is very bad."

It\u2019s like they purposely make it difficult to get any real help, leaving you stuck in an endless loop of ineffective support. If you value your time and sanity, stay far away from this app. Their customer service is an absolute disaster, and they clearly don't care about their users at all. Avoid this app at all costs."

They've had it for two or three years. I can't make changes because they have NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. In my opinion, they are a flim-fam scam outfit. They have it fixed so that when your money held with them reaches a certain low point (I think it's under $100 or something. I can't recall the exact amount. But when that happens, you can not take out your money. You can not take out under $100 of your own money. Therefore, you can't close your account. All this can (and I'm not saying it will or won't or giving advice) mess up your income tax. I really think what they do is against the law and they should be sued and charged. I've been out of crypto for about three years but can't close this account. My money belongs to them. Please, if you deal in crypto, do business with a reputable place. None of them are great but I think coinbase may be as close to honest as any of them. Crypto.com is very bad."

It\u2019s like they purposely make it difficult to get any real help, leaving you stuck in an endless loop of ineffective support. If you value your time and sanity, stay far away from this app. Their customer service is an absolute disaster, and they clearly don't care about their users at all. Avoid this app at all costs."

                "review": "It's a beginner platform for crypto. It's nice that there are no \"fees\" (there are, but more on that later). It's easy to use and after 3 years of use, I find both the Crypto app and the Crypto DeFi Wallet app to be both reliable and consistent. For what it is, I'm a fan of the platform. If you're a more frequent trader looking for advanced features and a fully-functioned UI, then another big service will likely be better for you.My gripe is in the \"no fees\" deal. You don't get charged per trade. You don't get charged for many things you do get charged for on other platforms. Sounds great, but they make their money in their spread.For instance: the other day, POL was trading around 53 cents Canadian, globally. My wallet tells me it's at 57 cents because that's the price I need to pay to buy it on Crypto .com with no fees. If I want to sell my 53 cent crypto, I'll end up with 49-50 cents per coin. With no fees. If I want to e-transfer it to myself, a generally free service, there's a $2 fee.So basically, unless you plan to buy and hold long and/or stake, then use another platform. Otherwise, you're going to get nickel'd and dimed straight to the poor house. That's why 4 stars. But honestly, the apps work fine and trading is as easy as it's going to get for a newcomer."

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on.

After I made payment, I had to keep asking for an update. A few days later I got a call from Crypto.com workers posing as the company my crypto was sent from saying they have identified my crypto has been sent back to them and that they will be assisting me to get it back.  They sent me an empty amount of crypto, then made me spend almost \u00a37000 to buy Ethereum claiming that is 5%of my crypto needed for liquidity and linking my wallet Etc. Not knowing this was fraud, I paid and they kept coming back for more. I started asking questions and they were getting very rude and aggressive so I contacted the other company directly and was told that they have not been interacting with me.  They told me that I had been scammed and tried to help me to recognise the difference between the two being the fake emails and logo\u2019s Etc.  I was so shocked as the scammer\u2019s were so professional and knew everything ( this is why I believe it is workers from Crypto.com).  I even had to send my identity and was going back and forth on phone, email and also whatsapp.   After they received \u00a37,000 through the fraud, Crypto.com them messed me with an update officially in my account that they cannot help me as my crypto is lost and that they will be refunding the \u00a3150 fee ( which they did ).  But at the end, all my crypto were taken and I was scammed \u00a37000 and they were still calling and emailing at the same time asking for another \u00a34,800 to link wallet.  I have tried to get help but there is no help as the customer service is the scammer\u2019s you are talking to so you\u2019re going back and forth in circles or getting ignored.  These are professional scammer\u2019s .  DO NOT RISK INVESTING YOUR MONEY OR CRYPTO HERE !\ud83d\udcaf% THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUDULENT COMPANY.   THEY ATE NOT RECOGNISED BY ANY FINANCIAL BODIES.  THEY HAVE BEEN STRICKEN OFF AS A COMPANY AND MARKED AS FRAUDULENT BY PROFESSIONALS . They have no customer support, no customer service, only scammer\u2019s posing as customer support/customer service.  I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN SCAMMED!!Call the police!"

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on.

A few days later I got a call from Crypto.com workers posing as the company my crypto was sent from saying they have identified my crypto has been sent back to them and that they will be assisting me to get it back.  They sent me an empty amount of crypto, then made me spend almost \u00a37000 to buy Ethereum claiming that is 5%of my crypto needed for liquidity and linking my wallet Etc. Not knowing this was fraud, I paid and they kept coming back for more. I started asking questions and they were getting very rude and aggressive so I contacted the other company directly and was told that they have not been interacting with me.  They told me that I had been scammed and tried to help me to recognise the difference between the two being the fake emails and logo\u2019s Etc.

I even had to send my identity and was going back and forth on phone, email and also whatsapp.   After they received \u00a37,000 through the fraud, Crypto.com them messed me with an update officially in my account that they cannot help me as my crypto is lost and that they will be refunding the \u00a3150 fee ( which they did ).  But at the end, all my crypto were taken and I was scammed \u00a37000 and they were still calling and emailing at the same time asking for another \u00a34,800 to link wallet.  I have tried to get help but there is no help as the customer service is the scammer\u2019s you are talking to so you\u2019re going back and forth in circles or getting ignored.  These are professional scammer\u2019s .  DO NOT RISK INVESTING YOUR MONEY OR CRYPTO HERE !\ud83d\udcaf% THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUDULENT COMPANY.   THEY ATE NOT RECOGNISED BY ANY FINANCIAL BODIES.  THEY HAVE BEEN STRICKEN OFF AS A COMPANY AND MARKED AS FRAUDULENT BY PROFESSIONALS . They have no customer support, no customer service, only scammer\u2019s posing as customer support/customer service.  I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN SCAMMED!!Call the police!"

Not knowing this was fraud, I paid and they kept coming back for more. I started asking questions and they were getting very rude and aggressive so I contacted the other company directly and was told that they have not been interacting with me.  They told me that I had been scammed and tried to help me to recognise the difference between the two being the fake emails and logo\u2019s Etc.  I was so shocked as the scammer\u2019s were so professional and knew everything ( this is why I believe it is workers from Crypto.com).  I even had to send my identity and was going back and forth on phone, email and also whatsapp.   After they received \u00a37,000 through the fraud, Crypto.com them messed me with an update officially in my account that they cannot help me as my crypto is lost and that they will be refunding the \u00a3150 fee ( which they did ).  But at the end, all my crypto were taken and I was scammed \u00a37000 and they were still calling and emailing at the same time asking for another \u00a34,800 to link wallet.  I have tried to get help but there is no help as the customer service is the scammer\u2019s you are talking to so you\u2019re going back and forth in circles or getting ignored.  These are professional scammer\u2019s .  DO NOT RISK INVESTING YOUR MONEY OR CRYPTO HERE !\ud83d\udcaf% THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUDULENT COMPANY.   THEY ATE NOT RECOGNISED BY ANY FINANCIAL BODIES.  THEY HAVE BEEN STRICKEN OFF AS A COMPANY AND MARKED AS FRAUDULENT BY PROFESSIONALS . They have no customer support, no customer service, only scammer\u2019s posing as customer support/customer service.  I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN SCAMMED!!Call the police!"

Meaning they pocket \u00a34 for every Sol unstaked. They are thieves. When using my self custody wallet and I unstake, I get the price the market reflects and theres no middleman to steal from me. So i open a support chat and ask why the difference in price and support replies with \u201cwhen you unstake solana you dont recieve fiat\u201d \ud83e\udd23..never said i did, i said the reference price was wrong but these are tactics they use to avoid answering to theft.

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on.

Escalated my ticket and waited 24 hours, they said my wallet addresses were associated with fraud...BS. so I put in my coinbase address and tried, CANCELLED. converted to LTC and tried again, cancelled every time. At this point ive lost 20% of my deposit because of their fees.

The Ocean Protocol I was sending was polygon and everyone who knows anything about crypto knows polygon is 100% ERC20 compatible. The thieving f@\u00a2+$ locked up my tokens saying I sent the wrong tokens to the address and wanted me to pay 100USDT for them to retrieve my tokens. The tokens value was around $95.

Then when you confront their support they reply \u201callow me another minute to look into this for you\u201d every 5 minutes as half an hour to now an hour goes by and zero help. Just them repeating this same message. I unstaked Solana and they gave me a price of 1 SOL = \u00a3114 when the price was clearly higher at \u00a3118. Meaning they pocket \u00a34 for every Sol unstaked. They are thieves. When using my self custody wallet and I unstake, I get the price the market reflects and theres no middleman to steal from me. So i open a support chat and ask why the difference in price and support replies with \u201cwhen you unstake solana you dont recieve fiat\u201d \ud83e\udd23..never said i did, i said the reference price was wrong but these are tactics they use to avoid answering to theft. Then I screenshot the unstake order and circle the incorrect reference price and send it to support. They go silent and refuse to acknowledge the picture but tell me \u201ccryptocoins dont have fixed prices\u201d\u2026.this is their answer to why i was paid \u00a3114 per Solana i unstaked instead of \u00a3118 per solana unstaked\u2026.that cryptos dont have fixed prices and to give me his opinion on how crypto works but never answered the question i asked. This is the most dangerous type of thief. A thief who thinks he is clever but little does he know\u2026.regulators will soon be asking the same question\u2026as when i file a complaint i go to the very top and dont give up until all has come to light."

The Ocean Protocol I was sending was polygon and everyone who knows anything about crypto knows polygon is 100% ERC20 compatible. The thieving f@\u00a2+$ locked up my tokens saying I sent the wrong tokens to the address and wanted me to pay 100USDT for them to retrieve my tokens. The tokens value was around $95. They better hope we never cross paths. They could improve by not stealing, scamming, and representing why some should of been swallowed instead of conceived.

Then when you confront their support they reply \u201callow me another minute to look into this for you\u201d every 5 minutes as half an hour to now an hour goes by and zero help. Just them repeating this same message. I unstaked Solana and they gave me a price of 1 SOL = \u00a3114 when the price was clearly higher at \u00a3118. Meaning they pocket \u00a34 for every Sol unstaked. They are thieves. When using my self custody wallet and I unstake, I get the price the market reflects and theres no middleman to steal from me. So i open a support chat and ask why the difference in price and support replies with \u201cwhen you unstake solana you dont recieve fiat\u201d \ud83e\udd23..never said i did, i said the reference price was wrong but these are tactics they use to avoid answering to theft. Then I screenshot the unstake order and circle the incorrect reference price and send it to support. They go silent and refuse to acknowledge the picture but tell me \u201ccryptocoins dont have fixed prices\u201d\u2026.this is their answer to why i was paid \u00a3114 per Solana i unstaked instead of \u00a3118 per solana unstaked\u2026.that cryptos dont have fixed prices and to give me his opinion on how crypto works but never answered the question i asked. This is the most dangerous type of thief. A thief who thinks he is clever but little does he know\u2026.regulators will soon be asking the same question\u2026as when i file a complaint i go to the very top and dont give up until all has come to light."

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

Support is no help at all, I ended up transferring to FIAT again losing more to fees and withdrawing it. what is wrong with this company, huge regret trying them out and will never ever look back, disgusting and straight TRASH."

Then when you confront their support they reply \u201callow me another minute to look into this for you\u201d every 5 minutes as half an hour to now an hour goes by and zero help. Just them repeating this same message. I unstaked Solana and they gave me a price of 1 SOL = \u00a3114 when the price was clearly higher at \u00a3118. Meaning they pocket \u00a34 for every Sol unstaked. They are thieves. When using my self custody wallet and I unstake, I get the price the market reflects and theres no middleman to steal from me. So i open a support chat and ask why the difference in price and support replies with \u201cwhen you unstake solana you dont recieve fiat\u201d \ud83e\udd23..never said i did, i said the reference price was wrong but these are tactics they use to avoid answering to theft. Then I screenshot the unstake order and circle the incorrect reference price and send it to support. They go silent and refuse to acknowledge the picture but tell me \u201ccryptocoins dont have fixed prices\u201d\u2026.this is their answer to why i was paid \u00a3114 per Solana i unstaked instead of \u00a3118 per solana unstaked\u2026.that cryptos dont have fixed prices and to give me his opinion on how crypto works but never answered the question i asked. This is the most dangerous type of thief. A thief who thinks he is clever but little does he know\u2026.regulators will soon be asking the same question\u2026as when i file a complaint i go to the very top and dont give up until all has come to light."

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

Then when you confront their support they reply \u201callow me another minute to look into this for you\u201d every 5 minutes as half an hour to now an hour goes by and zero help. Just them repeating this same message. I unstaked Solana and they gave me a price of 1 SOL = \u00a3114 when the price was clearly higher at \u00a3118. Meaning they pocket \u00a34 for every Sol unstaked. They are thieves. When using my self custody wallet and I unstake, I get the price the market reflects and theres no middleman to steal from me. So i open a support chat and ask why the difference in price and support replies with \u201cwhen you unstake solana you dont recieve fiat\u201d \ud83e\udd23..never said i did, i said the reference price was wrong but these are tactics they use to avoid answering to theft. Then I screenshot the unstake order and circle the incorrect reference price and send it to support. They go silent and refuse to acknowledge the picture but tell me \u201ccryptocoins dont have fixed prices\u201d\u2026.this is their answer to why i was paid \u00a3114 per Solana i unstaked instead of \u00a3118 per solana unstaked\u2026.that cryptos dont have fixed prices and to give me his opinion on how crypto works but never answered the question i asked. This is the most dangerous type of thief. A thief who thinks he is clever but little does he know\u2026.regulators will soon be asking the same question\u2026as when i file a complaint i go to the very top and dont give up until all has come to light."

If you use their wallet to buy and sell, then you would be charged more based on the spread fee that is expensive. The choice is yours. I don't understand why people give a one star for nothing. I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

Then when you confront their support they reply \u201callow me another minute to look into this for you\u201d every 5 minutes as half an hour to now an hour goes by and zero help. Just them repeating this same message. I unstaked Solana and they gave me a price of 1 SOL = \u00a3114 when the price was clearly higher at \u00a3118. Meaning they pocket \u00a34 for every Sol unstaked. They are thieves. When using my self custody wallet and I unstake, I get the price the market reflects and theres no middleman to steal from me. So i open a support chat and ask why the difference in price and support replies with \u201cwhen you unstake solana you dont recieve fiat\u201d \ud83e\udd23..never said i did, i said the reference price was wrong but these are tactics they use to avoid answering to theft. Then I screenshot the unstake order and circle the incorrect reference price and send it to support. They go silent and refuse to acknowledge the picture but tell me \u201ccryptocoins dont have fixed prices\u201d\u2026.this is their answer to why i was paid \u00a3114 per Solana i unstaked instead of \u00a3118 per solana unstaked\u2026.that cryptos dont have fixed prices and to give me his opinion on how crypto works but never answered the question i asked. This is the most dangerous type of thief. A thief who thinks he is clever but little does he know\u2026.regulators will soon be asking the same question\u2026as when i file a complaint i go to the very top and dont give up until all has come to light."

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

If you use their wallet to buy and sell, then you would be charged more based on the spread fee that is expensive. The choice is yours. I don't understand why people give a one star for nothing. I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

Their customer service continues to give robotic, canned responses and has essentially ghosted me. They\u2019ve wasted not only my money but also my time.I would strongly advise anyone considering using Crypto.com to think twice. If something goes wrong, expect zero support.

        "overall_prompt_summary": "The key findings from the discussions highlight the critical importance of close collaboration with industry partners for sustainable growth in the digital payments ecosystem, as emphasized by StraitsX's compliance-first approach. The integration of digital and traditional assets in global finance was a focal point, underscoring the necessity of building mutual trust across public and private sectors to facilitate effective collaboration. Challenges for public-private partnerships (PPPs) often arise from differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities, which can either accelerate or hinder progress. The discussions suggest that aligning these expectations and frameworks is crucial for overcoming roadblocks. Further investigation could explore strategies for harmonizing regulatory approaches and operational practices to enhance collaboration and innovation in the digital payments landscape.",

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

After falling victim to a scam that resulted in $5,000 being stolen from my account, Crypto.com has refused to take any responsibility or provide reimbursement. Despite promptly reporting the fraud, following all security measures, and even having the FBI involved, Crypto.com has been dismissive and unhelpful throughout the entire process.They submitted false information to my bank, claiming I received merchandise when the transactions were clearly part of a fraudulent scheme. Their customer service continues to give robotic, canned responses and has essentially ghosted me. They\u2019ve wasted not only my money but also my time.I would strongly advise anyone considering using Crypto.com to think twice. If something goes wrong, expect zero support. This company does not stand behind its users when fraud occurs. Save yourself the frustration and avoid Crypto.com at all costs"

After falling victim to a scam that resulted in $5,000 being stolen from my account, Crypto.com has refused to take any responsibility or provide reimbursement. Despite promptly reporting the fraud, following all security measures, and even having the FBI involved, Crypto.com has been dismissive and unhelpful throughout the entire process.They submitted false information to my bank, claiming I received merchandise when the transactions were clearly part of a fraudulent scheme. Their customer service continues to give robotic, canned responses and has essentially ghosted me. They\u2019ve wasted not only my money but also my time.I would strongly advise anyone considering using Crypto.com to think twice. If something goes wrong, expect zero support. This company does not stand behind its users when fraud occurs. Save yourself the frustration and avoid Crypto.com at all costs"

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on.

Escalated my ticket and waited 24 hours, they said my wallet addresses were associated with fraud...BS. so I put in my coinbase address and tried, CANCELLED. converted to LTC and tried again, cancelled every time. At this point ive lost 20% of my deposit because of their fees.

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

If you use their wallet to buy and sell, then you would be charged more based on the spread fee that is expensive. The choice is yours. I don't understand why people give a one star for nothing. I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

If you use their wallet to buy and sell, then you would be charged more based on the spread fee that is expensive. The choice is yours. I don't understand why people give a one star for nothing. I think some people may not know how to use the platform and then they claim that the platform does not work. The truth is there is nothing wrong with the platform. If you cannot withdraw your money, it means you need to comply with the regulations of the platform such as you having to provide your government ID, and so on. Many people here alleged the company is a scammer. My answer is they are not. If it was, I could not have withdrawn my crypto a few times."

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

Crypto.com had cause me a great deal of pain until now my money is pending and the main reason I did the transaction was to be able to send a payment to an external wallet while they keep saying that I couldn\u2019t do any transfers but I could buy crypto I think it\u2019s a way for them to use your money for their own profit for 7 days while you are stuck and can\u2019t use the money for the purpose you put it there awful awful now I\u2019m stuck and can\u2019t use the money while my bank cleared it for days now so if you need to use your money right away don\u2019t use Crypto.com because their instant transfer is a lie and you have to wait over 7days to be able to use it ridiculous!"

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

(Very bad decision) ie you need to enter a code texted to your phone number to withdraw your funds or even to sign into your account.Now this would be find IF you were able to change this number when overseas. Can you? NOPE. YOU CANNOT.Oh OK, so maybe a virtual number? Sure, this is possible if you're from somewhere like the US that has Google voice. Other places, this is not possible AND regardless, you can't change it to a number thar isn't from your original country.Do they have another solution to offer ?One you can do everytime you need to verify:You have to verify your identity with a photo and a lot of personal info every time you want to do something in your account so they can disable this number verification (many hours later after sending to the relevant team for appraisal) But, when asked, they also won't send their data storage and sharing/ privacy policy to you when they ask for this personal information either (i mean you want this given how much private info they want from you and you have no idea who the other person is right?).Do they have another solution?No. Just platitudes from reps.What's the TLDR?Cro is holding my funds ransom and will not solve the issue or escalate to an appropriate person to talk to.This is way worse than a bank.Solve the problem CRO and allow me to change my number or get a security consultant to give you 20 different ways you can ensure security without illegally locking people's funds up for being overseas"

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

Crypto.com had cause me a great deal of pain until now my money is pending and the main reason I did the transaction was to be able to send a payment to an external wallet while they keep saying that I couldn\u2019t do any transfers but I could buy crypto I think it\u2019s a way for them to use your money for their own profit for 7 days while you are stuck and can\u2019t use the money for the purpose you put it there awful awful now I\u2019m stuck and can\u2019t use the money while my bank cleared it for days now so if you need to use your money right away don\u2019t use Crypto.com because their instant transfer is a lie and you have to wait over 7days to be able to use it ridiculous!"

Something about i need to do something with CRO for 365 days or something? Is it saying i need to trade a certain amount for 365 days before i can get the card?? Why is there even requirements to the card?? You dont need requirments to get a bank cars!!! Its not straight forward to usr and no boomer is going understand this app and do we not want more people on crypto? Im 41 and fairly good with tech and im super confused with crypto.com app, been using binance for years and would stay if the UK didnt f everything up!

(Very bad decision) ie you need to enter a code texted to your phone number to withdraw your funds or even to sign into your account.Now this would be find IF you were able to change this number when overseas. Can you? NOPE. YOU CANNOT.Oh OK, so maybe a virtual number? Sure, this is possible if you're from somewhere like the US that has Google voice. Other places, this is not possible AND regardless, you can't change it to a number thar isn't from your original country.Do they have another solution to offer ?One you can do everytime you need to verify:You have to verify your identity with a photo and a lot of personal info every time you want to do something in your account so they can disable this number verification (many hours later after sending to the relevant team for appraisal) But, when asked, they also won't send their data storage and sharing/ privacy policy to you when they ask for this personal information either (i mean you want this given how much private info they want from you and you have no idea who the other person is right?).Do they have another solution?No. Just platitudes from reps.What's the TLDR?Cro is holding my funds ransom and will not solve the issue or escalate to an appropriate person to talk to.This is way worse than a bank.Solve the problem CRO and allow me to change my number or get a security consultant to give you 20 different ways you can ensure security without illegally locking people's funds up for being overseas"

The slippage is 20% and while they claim no fees when you trade crypto for crypto you end up losing a shitton. Like 9000 of ETH swapped to BTC becomes 7800, swap it again to AAVE and it becomes 6700 all in a minute so no real time for price action to change in a 1 for 1 swap, just pure slippage. When you deposit, they lock up all your money, even cleared funds. So if you have 1,000,000 dollars in the accoutn and instant deposit $100, you will have to wait a whole 2 weeks (7 business days) to get access to your million just because you deposited 100 dollars.Lastly, they have all these promotions and 'missions' and airdrops. They are real, but most of the time they will avoid paying you out even if you follow all the steps. They'll say something like 'You needed 200 dollars worth and for 5 seconds it dropped to 199.99 so it invalidated you from getting the reward'. Three times they avoided rewarding me saying the promotion was not valid in my locale. They should be smarter and show promotions only to locations that can participate."

I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

I think the apps and the exchange are very user friendly, and transfers between the exchange and wallets are seamless and simple to do. I've transferred money back out to my bank with no issue on several occasions, used the customer service chat twice now, once because I needed my 2fa reset after changing my phone and more recently as a dodgy transaction caused my cdc card to not top up successfully. Both times I received an immediate responce from customer support and both times the issue was resolved without any hassle. Yes, as some people have said the deal when selling on the phone apps is expensive, this is due to spread and can be easily avoided by buying and selling on the exchange, where fees are literal pennies."

Thou its not a 5 star! I just got it so i can pay money into my UK bank as binance has removed bank transfers! My issue is 1 its far to confusing and had to YT it, 2 \u00a320 deposit to set up a GBP wallet is way too much and you dont need more then \u00a31 to confirm your account and this straight away makes it look like a scammy company! 3 the requirements to get the card don\u2019t make sense! Something about i need to do something with CRO for 365 days or something? Is it saying i need to trade a certain amount for 365 days before i can get the card?? Why is there even requirements to the card?? You dont need requirments to get a bank cars!!! Its not straight forward to usr and no boomer is going understand this app and do we not want more people on crypto? Im 41 and fairly good with tech and im super confused with crypto.com app, been using binance for years and would stay if the UK didnt f everything up! Also my bank is blatently going to block my \u00a320 deposit!!! Edit those 1 stars are real this company is terrible and after doing a deep dive i learnt some terrible things about this company so i transferred to coinbase and they charged 3x times the amount as binance on the same ERC-20 network avoid this company! It looks likes its actually the 5star ratings that are fake."

(Very bad decision) ie you need to enter a code texted to your phone number to withdraw your funds or even to sign into your account.Now this would be find IF you were able to change this number when overseas. Can you? NOPE. YOU CANNOT.Oh OK, so maybe a virtual number? Sure, this is possible if you're from somewhere like the US that has Google voice. Other places, this is not possible AND regardless, you can't change it to a number thar isn't from your original country.Do they have another solution to offer ?One you can do everytime you need to verify:You have to verify your identity with a photo and a lot of personal info every time you want to do something in your account so they can disable this number verification (many hours later after sending to the relevant team for appraisal) But, when asked, they also won't send their data storage and sharing/ privacy policy to you when they ask for this personal information either (i mean you want this given how much private info they want from you and you have no idea who the other person is right?).Do they have another solution?No. Just platitudes from reps.What's the TLDR?Cro is holding my funds ransom and will not solve the issue or escalate to an appropriate person to talk to.This is way worse than a bank.Solve the problem CRO and allow me to change my number or get a security consultant to give you 20 different ways you can ensure security without illegally locking people's funds up for being overseas"

I contacted customer service right away and was told i can only send funds through fiat, I requested they returnd the direct deposit back to which they refused. the customer service rep insisted I can only access my funds by linking account. I proceeded to link my external account on 11/11/2024 but till date it is still in pending status. Customer service has been terse and borderline rude in their reply. they refuse to return my funds to the originating account or allow me add my external fiat account. Please help!!!!"

Impossible to do so as they send a text to your mobile number lol. O other verification method availble. I have been in touch for support for them to close my acocunt. They simply refused hahaha. It's been going on for the past couple of weeks. Now I am sharing my experience on every social network and review website I can. Instead of losing a customer with an empty account, they are potentially losing millions with potential customers looking at those bad reviews. Good luck"

The only option is to change the source of fund, such as credit card. Why should I fund again my wallet? Does not make sense. I can buy a new asset by selecting \"One Time\" option instead of \"Target Price\", but i will be buying the current price, which is not what i want. Customer service cannot help. Customer service is just a BOT and cannot understand the issue. What a joke. Stay away from Crypto.com and look for better alternatives."

                "review": "On November 21, 2024, I registered to get a Visa card through the Crypto.com app. I deposited 28,403.423696 CRO and followed the interface steps to obtain the card. The process continued to the final step, only to inform me that they are not yet operating in my country.I assumed that if they wouldn\u2019t send me the card, they would return my CRO. However, they refused to release the locked CRO, stating that it would remain locked for one year.I then reached out to the helpdesk, starting with the usual AI chatbot. It redirected me to a 'support specialist,' but this also turned out to be an AI. I spent over an hour in the chat, during which it repeatedly claimed to be \"checking\" but neither resolved the issue nor provided any meaningful assistance.While writing this review I tried another time the 'support specialist' and yet another hour with 'I appreciate you waiting' , 'Thanks you for the information'. Update: I' am still waiting after my sleep hours to get an update.. from the 'specialist support.'Here\u2019s a lesson for everyone regarding this company: they lock your assets even when they cannot provide the service (in this case, the Visa card). They fail to notify you in advance if your country is not within their market area. Their support system is a two-tier facade. First, there\u2019s the familiar chatbot, and then what they claim to be a \"specialist\" turns out to be a more advanced AI. In fact, there was no delay between interacting with the chatbot and being transferred to the \"specialist,\" which is unusual for a global company where you typically expect some wait time before reaching human support.Remember, as people in the crypto community often say on social networks: once your money is on their platform, it\u2019s no longer truly yours.Speaking of social networks, after dealing with the first \"specialist,\" I created an account on X to share my experience by commenting under the latest post from Crypto.com's CEO, @kris, hoping to draw attention to my issue. Strangely, my new account was soon locked out\u2014not with an official ban but with a login issue (still so after some hours) . I asked a friend to check if my comment was still visible, and he confirmed it had been removed. So... you have been warned."

I have no idea how this happened, as I didn\u2019t share any sensitive information or take any actions that might have compromised my account.I reached out to Crypto.com immediately, but it took over a week of constant chasing to get a response. Their conclusion? They refused to take any responsibility and offered no compensation whatsoever.I find their security protocols questionable, and their customer service experience was frustrating and unhelpful. Based on my experience, I do not trust this platform and would strongly advise against using their services. It\u2019s not safe, and their support team fails to provide proper assistance when you need it the most. Look elsewhere for a more secure and reliable option."

Impossible to do so as they send a text to your mobile number lol. O other verification method availble. I have been in touch for support for them to close my acocunt. They simply refused hahaha. It's been going on for the past couple of weeks. Now I am sharing my experience on every social network and review website I can. Instead of losing a customer with an empty account, they are potentially losing millions with potential customers looking at those bad reviews. Good luck"

I have no idea how this happened, as I didn\u2019t share any sensitive information or take any actions that might have compromised my account.I reached out to Crypto.com immediately, but it took over a week of constant chasing to get a response. Their conclusion? They refused to take any responsibility and offered no compensation whatsoever.I find their security protocols questionable, and their customer service experience was frustrating and unhelpful. Based on my experience, I do not trust this platform and would strongly advise against using their services. It\u2019s not safe, and their support team fails to provide proper assistance when you need it the most. Look elsewhere for a more secure and reliable option."

It's been going on for the past couple of weeks. Now I am sharing my experience on every social network and review website I can. Instead of losing a customer with an empty account, they are potentially losing millions with potential customers looking at those bad reviews. Good luck"

I have no idea how this happened, as I didn\u2019t share any sensitive information or take any actions that might have compromised my account.I reached out to Crypto.com immediately, but it took over a week of constant chasing to get a response. Their conclusion? They refused to take any responsibility and offered no compensation whatsoever.I find their security protocols questionable, and their customer service experience was frustrating and unhelpful. Based on my experience, I do not trust this platform and would strongly advise against using their services. It\u2019s not safe, and their support team fails to provide proper assistance when you need it the most. Look elsewhere for a more secure and reliable option."

I feel as though that these are not actual people working in this team. My first initial chat with them closed, because they have not updated me since then. They have led me on for hours to believe that someone is looking into this, but afterwards those hours are up, they say that they'll notify me on a update in a few hours. On the next day, I went back to the chat to see that there were no updates and had asked if this was going to take a week or month to resolved. To my surprise, they say that they do not have an exact timeline. (1st chat: 12d71f7d-b723-4006-8081-86c724484936)After giving them a week, I opened a second chat to see that they have not resolved the case. I've requested a way to contact higher management, and was left without any further responses. Again, I tried to follow up an hour later, but I believe that the chat has been muted.

The people providing the useless verbal output on the in app chat function, are repeating your words to give you the illusion of an answer, without bringing you a solution at all. I doubt if they know English at all or are just using a AI translator. Their knowledge of Crypto.com is non existent. They probably outsourced this part of the company to a company, specialized in fictive customer service. Paying some teenies to man an app with AI and google translate."

And then I come online today, see it\u2019s frozen, I contact support, they tell me, it\u2019s on a cooldown period. And it will be available again after 24 hours.(Tomorrow) Then a couple of hours later, I see that they had traded my IRISnet for the lowest price possible to USDC. Without my approval or information!After 1 hour of chatting with their support, they inform me, that they did all they could to inform their customers! And it\u2019s not on them! (Hahaha what!!!)I asked for information so I could email or phone or any contact information for his superiors, he said he was not allowed to share that information for security reasons!! (Their public relations information is a security problem, I asked for any department head email information and was directly refused after the 7th question of the information!.Im so happy I found out so early in my process with them! I only invested 1.200 euro. So I was only beginning!I would 100% sure suggest Binance or seriously! ANY other platform, this one is as close to a scam as anything can get, without getting that stamp! I would definitely claim they scammed me.I have documented everything. So anyone wanting the documentation is welcome to contact me on my alternate mail address (samer1985 @live.dk) I will ofc transfer away from that platform asap!I have nothing to hold meThere anymore. I will take the little loss, but gain the right to warn off people from this scam!Just not worth the trouble it brings"

When i checked my DeFi (which has since changed name to Onchain wallet) to find all of my Shiba has been electronically withdrawn.  This guy stole all of my crypto.Now Crypto dot come says he did not work for th em and there's nothing they can do.I have contacted them twice, telling them they have responsibility because this guy was acting as their support live chat person.

I feel as though that these are not actual people working in this team. My first initial chat with them closed, because they have not updated me since then. They have led me on for hours to believe that someone is looking into this, but afterwards those hours are up, they say that they'll notify me on a update in a few hours. On the next day, I went back to the chat to see that there were no updates and had asked if this was going to take a week or month to resolved. To my surprise, they say that they do not have an exact timeline. After giving them a week, I opened a second chat to see that they have not resolved the case. I've requested a way to contact higher management, and was left without any further responses. Again, I tried to follow up an hour later, but I believe that the chat has been muted.

The spread is absurd, limit orders are basically not possible. (Technology, yes they are, but not really. I\u2019m not going to explain it here but you know what I mean.) ACH deposits and withdrawals move like muddy water. The Up/Down Strike and Leverage trading seems to be an internal market. The actual prices Crypto.COM are using are not tied to actual market prices.If you watch live market data feeds from dxFeed, Rithmic, or through Bookmap, CME or Trading View, and compare with Crypto.Com\u2019s market prices you will witness some serious Mickey Mouse price action. I would recommend staying away from this platform, or you can try it for yourself and most likely arrive at the same conclusion. Stay Safe and Stay Informed.

My account has been on temporarily paused since 11/24 with $2000 being held hostage and no responses of any resolution from the chat and email of the customer support team.Whenever I follow up with them, the customer support team use scripts or AI for their responses. I feel as though that these are not actual people working in this team. My first initial chat with them closed, because they have not updated me since then. They have led me on for hours to believe that someone is looking into this, but afterwards those hours are up, they say that they'll notify me on a update in a few hours. On the next day, I went back to the chat to see that there were no updates and had asked if this was going to take a week or month to resolved. To my surprise, they say that they do not have an exact timeline. After giving them a week, I opened a second chat to see that they have not resolved the case. I've requested a way to contact higher management, and was left without any further responses. Again, I tried to follow up an hour later, but I believe that the chat has been muted. Crypto.com are complete scammers."
