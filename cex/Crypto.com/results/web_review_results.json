The whole system works around holding of CRO and they use that token to cash out to pay for marketing and internal costs. My CRO went from A$1 to $0.10 and during the crypto recovery when bitcoin went ATH the CRO token barely whimpered as they cashed in. These are the worst group of people in the Crypto industry yet to be prosecuted. Dont. DONT DONT!! use this platform. I am not against Crypto but these people are snakes by any other name."

It's kind of clunky and not that intuitive or streamlined.  It's certainly not pretty.  But it worked for me.  Also, compared to other platforms...I thought the fees were alright. I will use the platform again."

After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning.

No matter how many times I tried, It kept saying \"network error, please try again.\" Everything else in the app was live and well so it definitely was NOT a network problem. Is it a coincidence that just when I was making good money that all of a sudden we have network errors that wouldn't let me sell the contract? I cleared the app's cache, restarted it, nothing worked. Eventually, after an hour or two, the contract went the other way until it was blown up and I went from nice profits to very ugly losses. These kinds of things should NEVER happen on a trading platform! So far they didn't bother to respond to my email about the incident, but I smell fraud from miles away. I lost trust in them."

Then they told me to buy their card and use the money. Their must be made by AI. Artificial Imbeciles. Who will tell their client to spend their money in order to have it back? So the other imbecile here did what they told. So, all of a sudden they decided to freeze my card. I went to the app to try to unfreeze it and the app told me to get in touch. Again, how can an institution be so incompetent? I opened the chat and after a while I talked to someone who resembled a human being. After explaining my case 3 times she or he or they or ze told me to call a specialist. Wait. Who was I talking to then? A trained monkey?So here I am, two hours later waiting for someone with half a brain to solve my MISTERY OF THE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNFREEZE CARRRDDD."

My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

After many days of silence I have to recontact them, with the same epilogue. That happened many times.I have found big security issues. My visa debit card (always kept safe and not using it a lot, almost never online) was emptied by some hackers (180 \u20ac more or less). After more than 3 weeks I still don't have my money back or a new card to use it (I don't even know if they have shipped it or not. They have not been able to give me a precise answer about it).The app doesn't work well: you can't find your old conversations with the support, and if you close a conversation and no one have given you a new answer, you are not able to load it anymore and you have to reopen a new one from the beginning. Terrible.Fees are quite high and not very clear or transparent.So far, not a good experience. I don't recommend it."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

What caught me off guard was that you could not sell direct to a wallet and could only transfer to another crypto currency (which results in fees) by default. After working with support for several weeks, they claimed this on a caching issue, I finally got an agent that said I needed to set up my currency for this \"fiat wallet' and even though I had set my currency when I setup my account, I needed to do it again in this fiat wallet or it wasn't even selectable during the sell crypto process. This process by the way, was also difficult to get started. This resulted in mistakes trying to sell into other crypto currency for them to collect more fees. Why not just call it a wallet or \"my cash\" and why hide it also behind a name like fiat wallet. Additionally why block it behind another verification of funds to use when I had already chosen my default currency when I signed up.Extracting money from this \"fiat wallet\" is also a chore hidden behind a shady process. Turns out you also need to DEPOSIT money into this Fiat Wallet for it to be able to withdrawl on first use. S9 not only haveI already deposited money so you know where it came from, you make me do it AGAIN. On top of that, I deposited the min allowed to get it going ($20) and THEN found out you cannot withdrawl unless you are withdrawing at least $100. So I needed to deposit even more money to take it all back (with a fee of course).While Crypto functions may work, the business practices of the company in these examples was enough for me not to trust this company. Add to that it took weeks of back and forth just to get my 'fiat wallet' issue looked at, stay clear."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

What caught me off guard was that you could not sell direct to a wallet and could only transfer to another crypto currency (which results in fees) by default. After working with support for several weeks, they claimed this on a caching issue, I finally got an agent that said I needed to set up my currency for this \"fiat wallet' and even though I had set my currency when I setup my account, I needed to do it again in this fiat wallet or it wasn't even selectable during the sell crypto process. This process by the way, was also difficult to get started. This resulted in mistakes trying to sell into other crypto currency for them to collect more fees. Why not just call it a wallet or \"my cash\" and why hide it also behind a name like fiat wallet. Additionally why block it behind another verification of funds to use when I had already chosen my default currency when I signed up.Extracting money from this \"fiat wallet\" is also a chore hidden behind a shady process. Turns out you also need to DEPOSIT money into this Fiat Wallet for it to be able to withdrawl on first use. S9 not only haveI already deposited money so you know where it came from, you make me do it AGAIN. On top of that, I deposited the min allowed to get it going ($20) and THEN found out you cannot withdrawl unless you are withdrawing at least $100. So I needed to deposit even more money to take it all back (with a fee of course).While Crypto functions may work, the business practices of the company in these examples was enough for me not to trust this company. Add to that it took weeks of back and forth just to get my 'fiat wallet' issue looked at, stay clear."

While the security features and user-friendly interface are praised, these positives are overshadowed by the negative experiences of many users. Critical issues seem to center on functionality, particularly with account access, which is a fundamental aspect of user experience. The poor performance of the interface suggests a need for technical improvements to enhance stability and usability. To address these concerns and improve overall satisfaction, the app developers should prioritize enhancing customer support, refining the interface, and ensuring reliable account access.",

They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

                "review": "I've used this for almost a year now, and had no real issues.. both with using my crypto card (have had two different cards) and with sending funds to other wallets. im sure many of the issues mentioned here are real, and clearly they need to invest in (human) customer support- but details like network fees (just stick with Solana), gas fees, lockup times, the importance of correct chain choice between wallets - there are online tutorials, and prices are mentioned in the terms and other places online, it's not unique to cryptocom, it's not a scam, it's a business model. but some of you seem to be complaining about real scams, \"first you call me and sell me this app, with too many adds and then you took my money\" doesn't sound like the actual crypto.com. fees aren't scams, the one you just paid made some graph jump, that's pretty much the game. Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

                "review": "This by far has got to be the worst Absolutely terrible experience with this crypto app. They market it as a versatile Visa card you can use anywhere, but that's far from the truth. They entice you to deposit $30, but once your money is on the card, you're hit with countless restrictions. You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there. Avoid this app at all costs. It\u2019s the worst by far."

                "review": "I've used this for almost a year now, and had no real issues.. both with using my crypto card (have had two different cards) and with sending funds to other wallets. im sure many of the issues mentioned here are real, and clearly they need to invest in (human) customer support- but details like network fees (just stick with Solana), gas fees, lockup times, the importance of correct chain choice between wallets - there are online tutorials, and prices are mentioned in the terms and other places online, it's not unique to cryptocom, it's not a scam, it's a business model. but some of you seem to be complaining about real scams, \"first you call me and sell me this app, with too many adds and then you took my money\" doesn't sound like the actual crypto.com. fees aren't scams, the one you just paid made some graph jump, that's pretty much the game. Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

After well over a week working with customer service they offered to move the funds via wire transfer to my bank.  That was 5 days ago and the wire transfer has still not occurred.  I keep raising it to customer service and they keep telling me to be patient.  They are seizing my funds and not allowing me access to the funds and refuse to resolve the issue.   I wish someone would form a class action suit against them so that everyone who has been screwed by them can join it and get damages for illegally seizing funds and holding them in Crypto and refusing to release the funds back to the rightful owners"

You can't add it to Apple Pay or use it with popular transaction apps like Cash App. Essentially, they mislead you about how you can use your funds.I was furious to find out I couldn't do what I wanted with my own money. When I decided to close my account, they kept my crypto. They should have cashed it out, but they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money. I also had to buy a $5 debit card, and overall, I wasted about $20 in just a week using this app.There are far more customer-friendly and beneficial alternatives out there.

Research the difference between btc/eth/sol-chains before you pick one for juggling money. I would much rather pay a slightly higher fixed instaprice for coins and hold a month than to mettle around with \"trade orders\" in the other apps myself. i stick with .com and phantom mostly. i really like the design, even though the graphs seem warped (why is 2021 taking up so much space?) and I would really love a candle option... to the guy giving one star because he can't figure out google authenticator, proudly spamming them with 200 emails about it: how about just googling it? YouTube it. You can't \"demand\" a phonecall because you can't figure out 2way authentication, you're blocking CS to people with real issues. one star because it's not available in your country yet, that's great \"one star because they ask for ID when I want to change my phone number, it's been days\" relax, that's a good thing. an actual human is processing your document. it shouldn't be easy to change your phone number. it shouldn't be easy to just \"withdraw all\" without any documentation. ...clearly, there are real issues they need to figure out, plus some millions spent on customer support would help this app rocket past some competitors. For the rest of us, maybe they could launch a tutorial video with a mandatory pop-quiz before people are allowed to register, and thereby get more informed reviews and receive relevant frustrations only.. now press the motorcycle if you understand that we will sit on your first $50 for a month. Crypto.com is here to help you digitalize and hopefully grow your assets- consider figuring out how to spend your profits digitally instead of stressing about the time or costs for transferring tiny amounts back to old banks in random countries (with their own fees) on day 3. if u fear red, or fumble and panic, sell to USDC to \"pause\" it until you understand, instead of spamming the withdrawal button. the crypto visacard will connect to googlepay and most online servicesthe AI bot everyone hates could refer to a part.com partcommunity driven discord server for platonic technical questions. sorry this got super lengthy, best of luck the future is blockchained #8000"

Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing. I would caution others to think twice before using Crypto.com, as my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare."

I got locked out of my Amazon account and was asked to provide my crypto.com card statement with my address and card number... It's been almost 3 days, and crypto.com support (wether via app or X) is unable to produce one. I also had to explain 4 times what is it I need. Still nothing. Something that should be easily available through the app is impossible to achieve in any way so far. You can get a transaction history as csv, which in my case is useless. Still their support was trying to push me there. 2 days back was the last time I heard from them. Thanking me for my patience and explaining they \"don't have a timeline\" to provide a card statement... Glad I didn't upgrade my card. It's good when it's working, you are on your own when it doesn't."

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.  Wire transfers take 1 - 2 days, and though you can\u2019t trade with those funds, once they arrive, you can, and you can withdraw whatever crypto you buy with wired funds immediately.

Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing.

Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing.

Days later I got tired of holding the coin so I just wanted to withdraw and do something else with my money.

I just click convert and I just see \u00a385 left. \u00a310 loss. Unbelievable. I convert from BTC to GBP and I see \u00a383 left. To withdraw it's a \u00a31.90 fee.

Over the past several months, I have transacted thousands of dollars through the Crypto.com app, paying significant fees in the process. Since December 2023, I have been trying to receive a refund for a transaction issue, and now, at the end of May 2024, my account is still frozen. Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing. I would caution others to think twice before using Crypto.com, as my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare."

Over the past several months, I have transacted thousands of dollars through the Crypto.com app, paying significant fees in the process. Since December 2023, I have been trying to receive a refund for a transaction issue, and now, at the end of May 2024, my account is still frozen. Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, I have not received any clear answers or timelines regarding when my account will be reviewed or when I can expect my refund. The lack of communication and transparency from Crypto.com is unacceptable. I trusted this platform with my funds, and the way I have been treated is extremely disappointing. I would caution others to think twice before using Crypto.com, as my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare."

I've had issues with my own bank not allowing transfers into my account, but that's not due to crypto.com.  I'm from the UK, so banks can be quite strict.  I've never used the defi app, so I can't comment on that.  I've also never had to contact customer support, so I can't comment on that either.The app can occasionally be slow, I've noticed that after some updates it has been a bit laggy, but at the moment there are no issues.  They offer a large range of tokens and a number of staking options.  The prices on here are higher than other exchanges as that's how they make their fees, unlike others that charge you a specific amount when you buy.Overall, I'm happy with the service and this exchange.  I also have their metal debit card, which I use all the time."

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.

I misunderstood something about deposits of FIAT currency, that ACH deposits, though you\u2019re able to trade with the funds immediately, have to be settle, and that takes 5 - 7 business days. The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.  Wire transfers take 1 - 2 days, and though you can\u2019t trade with those funds, once they arrive, you can, and you can withdraw whatever crypto you buy with wired funds immediately.

They have caused serious inconvenience and as you try explain this to them, they do not care. Definely use other platforms if you want to incvest in crypto. Stay far far away from Crypto.com and if you have an account with them, close it and open a Revolut account or something. Avoid by all cost for your peace of mind."

The single review dated June 06, 2024, with a 5-star rating, highlights confusion over mixed feedback, indicating overall satisfaction but pointing to inconsistencies in user experiences. Positive reviews generally praise the platform's service features, while negative reviews criticize its legal and operational aspects. The key findings suggest a need for better regulatory compliance and clearer communication to address user concerns. Further investigation should focus on understanding the regulatory landscape and improving institutional adoption to enhance overall user satisfaction.",

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore.

Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money.

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money.

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026.

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

A few weeks ago, i withdrew $100 worth of bitcoin. Upon checking the confirmation, i realized they took $56 out of my $100 withdrawal. Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

However, significant dissatisfaction stems from regulatory ambiguity, unmet investor expectations, poor customer service, high commissions, and frequent spam emails. The critical issues revolve around the lack of regulatory clarity and the failure to meet investor priorities, which overshadow the positive aspects of governance and community involvement. To improve, the company should focus on enhancing regulatory transparency, addressing investor concerns more effectively, and improving customer service responsiveness. Further investigation into reducing high commissions and minimizing spam emails could also help in addressing user dissatisfaction.",

There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026.

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

A few weeks ago, i withdrew $100 worth of bitcoin. Upon checking the confirmation, i realized they took $56 out of my $100 withdrawal. Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

Positive aspects include efficient processes, robust security, and speed, with users appreciating the coherent language and specific, informed content in governance and technical updates. However, critical issues such as poor customer service, high commissions, email spams, and P2P service problems are frequently mentioned. Negative reviews often point to repetitive patterns and generic phrasing, indicating a need for more transparency and personalized communication. To improve, addressing customer service concerns, reducing commissions, and minimizing email spams could enhance user satisfaction, while further investigation into P2P issues and content quality could provide deeper insights for refinement.",

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

A few weeks ago, i withdrew $100 worth of bitcoin. Upon checking the confirmation, i realized they took $56 out of my $100 withdrawal. Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money.

Over 50% was taken out of my already small withdrawal, and i cannot imagine what the \u201ctaxes and fees\u201d would be if it were $1000 or more. Just for reference, i just made a $200 withdrawal on coinbase not even a month later, and the total taxes and fees did not even add up to $1. I withdrew literally double and paid 50 times less. Their math simply makes no reasonable sense and at this point it could not be more blatant. They are scamming and not even hiding it anymore. Please at least try other trusted sites, this one will 100% steal from you. (P.S. - the customer service is next to nothing)"

I then tried to fund my account with an ATM card it kept getting rejected my credit card was rejected. There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026. I tried cash app and had immediate success and now use them to buy cryptocurrency\u2019s"

The app asked me to verify my details\u2026uploaded my bank statement (or a picture of it cause their systems wouldn\u2019t let you upload a pdf). Rejected 3 times then account blocked now they are still happy to continue to take deposits not an issue but now I can\u2019t withdraw. Get onto support so upload my driving licence and a biometric video. Then back to the app and upload me driving licence again. Recieve an email saying not acceptable. Decide to just close my account because I\u2019ve not had this trouble with any other provider. I am then told can\u2019t withdraw would have to transfer. Support then advise I should be able to withdraw and send me instructions. No joy so back to support to be advised that I can transfer to another wallet or forfeit the money. Decide to transfer (I\u2019m a complete novice) to then realise I\u2019ve been charged half of my balance to transfer to another wallet. Checked with the other wallet the fees are a quarter of what crypto are charging. Back to support I go\u2026oh y can you send me your id I was like please no not this again! Anyway I question the fees and ask for an email to raise a complaint. They refused and said they don\u2019t have any complaint and they will raise the issue and if I had a bank statement to send them. I refused because quite frankly I\u2019m concerned now that\u2019s these cowboys have got all my ID and it\u2019s clearly not a reputable company. If you made it this far well done\u2026my advice steer well clear of this company! I\u2019ve used eToro for example and not a single issue quick withdrawal no issues verifications easy. I\u2019m sure others will be much better too. Crypto.com seem like a bunch of chancers"

Why do they let you make a transfer, then they put it on hold, without reason, and then they will ask you to pay 150 Usd for a \"retrieval\" because it is so called complicated. Well it's not that complicated as I was told by a service agent from Binance. This is already the second time this is happening. My first transfer went through without problems,  but the seco d transfer is just costing more money. Customer support take very long....And discussion the issue via email is a complete charade. Crypto.com isn't even capable of discussing the issue at hand, they only refer to their advise and how good it, is but issue of Ada's not arriving is not discussed, only to pay money. This is pure racketeering and scamming people,  please stay away from Crypto.com."

The fact that you can trade with those funds immediately is actually quite awesome.  Wire transfers take 1 - 2 days, and though you can\u2019t trade with those funds, once they arrive, you can, and you can withdraw whatever crypto you buy with wired funds immediately.

I contacted their customer support to try and get the issue resolved. I got connected to one of their \u201eSpecialists\u201c who are NOT specialists at all. They first said it was a problem with the one time password (I don\u2019t have one time password active) but I went along anyway since I thought the must know. It took them TREE days to deactivate the OTP and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. They then said it was cause I wasn\u2019t using the passkey feature on IOS I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t). At this point it has been FIVE DAYS since I contacted their support. I gave up at this point. I\u2018m switching to a different exchange and I don\u2019t recommend anyone uses Crypto.com.

I then tried to fund my account with an ATM card it kept getting rejected my credit card was rejected. There was no way to fund my account I spent three weeks trying to fund my account and it never happened. Their support is a joke just people who read off a script and have no way to help you what so ever. Crypto.com is the worst app I ever tried to use\u2026. I tried cash app and had immediate success and now use them to buy cryptocurrency\u2019s"

I\u2018ve been using Crypto.com since 2020 and I\u2018ve had no issues until I got locked out of my account because I was trying to log in from a different country. I contacted their customer support to try and get the issue resolved. I got connected to one of their \u201eSpecialists\u201c who are NOT specialists at all. They first said it was a problem with the one time password (I don\u2019t have one time password active) but I went along anyway since I thought the must know. It took them TREE days to deactivate the OTP and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. They then said it was cause I wasn\u2019t using the passkey feature on IOS I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t). At this point it has been FIVE DAYS since I contacted their support. I gave up at this point. I\u2018m switching to a different exchange and I don\u2019t recommend anyone uses Crypto.com. Its great until you have an issue and their customer support won\u2019t help you in any way.

I contacted their customer support to try and get the issue resolved. I got connected to one of their \u201eSpecialists\u201c who are NOT specialists at all. They first said it was a problem with the one time password (I don\u2019t have one time password active) but I went along anyway since I thought the must know. It took them TREE days to deactivate the OTP and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. They then said it was cause I wasn\u2019t using the passkey feature on IOS I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t). At this point it has been FIVE DAYS since I contacted their support. I gave up at this point. I\u2018m switching to a different exchange and I don\u2019t recommend anyone uses Crypto.com.

I then sent them another screen recording of the error and they then said it was cause I was using an outdated email link to verify my login (I wasn\u2019t).

Positive feedback often centers on technological advancements, market growth, and the reliability of stablecoins, indicating satisfaction with innovation and financial stability. However, negative reviews point to challenges in blockchain adoption, market volatility, and concerns over stablecoin security, suggesting areas where implementation and financial risk management need improvement. The discussions reveal growing investor confidence, bolstered by increased blockchain adoption and stablecoin transactions, with minimal concerns about market manipulation. To further enhance the market, efforts could focus on addressing adoption barriers, mitigating volatility, and strengthening the security of stablecoins.",

However, about 2 weeks after coming back I am suddenly informed that my account has been terminated effective immediately due to \"A recent review of your Crypto.com account having revealed that your account activities do not meet our requirements for user conduct\". I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

Their excuse is that they use the lowest rate the currency was at within the last 24 hours. So if your investment jumps 1000% and you want to sell, you will only get -1000% back. How is anyone supposed to make a profit. In the end, I had invested in 8 different crypto currencies and all where in the green. I sold everything to move my account over to Wealth simple instead and not only did I not get any profit which should have been over 10% of my initial investment but I lost roughly 5% of my own money.

However, about 2 weeks after coming back I am suddenly informed that my account has been terminated effective immediately due to \"A recent review of your Crypto.com account having revealed that your account activities do not meet our requirements for user conduct\". I have no idea what that means and am not aware of any wrongdoing. Customer support not only refused any sort of appeal to that decision but has also refused to provide any  details on what exactly I am supposed to have done.  I have repeatedly asked for an explanation of what my \"misconduct\" is but I have been told that they cannot (whos stopping them?) provide any more detail other then the above quoted statement. I have been crypto.com customer for over 4 years and I cant even get an explanation why my account is terminated from one day to the next? I feel like in a Kafka novel, being sentenced without knowing what for and the authority refusing to tell me why!"

Their excuse is that they use the lowest rate the currency was at within the last 24 hours. So if your investment jumps 1000% and you want to sell, you will only get -1000% back. How is anyone supposed to make a profit. In the end, I had invested in 8 different crypto currencies and all where in the green. I sold everything to move my account over to Wealth simple instead and not only did I not get any profit which should have been over 10% of my initial investment but I lost roughly 5% of my own money.
