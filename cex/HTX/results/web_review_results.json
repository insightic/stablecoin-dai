So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

On the positive side, users commend the app for its security and ease of use, suggesting that the app's infrastructure for protecting user data and facilitating transactions is appreciated. However, the negative aspects overshadow these positives, with many users experiencing significant frustration due to technical problems and service quality. For potential improvement, the app developers should prioritize enhancing the user interface, streamlining account access, and bolstering customer support to address the key concerns and improve overall user satisfaction.",

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform.

Before I startedi checked the crypto currencies tradedon the exchange and saw that they were trading the ones i have had and deposited the currency, in this case Super RARE in a quite expensive way too. But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

Before I startedi checked the crypto currencies tradedon the exchange and saw that they were trading the ones i have had and deposited the currency, in this case Super RARE in a quite expensive way too. But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

The conversations identified that roadblocks for public-private partnerships (PPPs) often arise from differing expectations, regulatory frameworks, and operational realities.

So easy to use their wallet to deposit and withdraw, also from time to time there are primelists. I made more than 50 withdraw and deposit and no one pended. I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

But wheni wanted to set up a trade learned that the exchange doesnt trade this currency anymore. I found this quite misleading because the exchanges accept only the currencies they trade. I didn't get any notification whatsoever when I deposited. When I escalated this just got a sorry for the inconvenience and that I could withdraw it if I wanted, of course with high transaction costs and withdrawal costs charged by HUOBI. It is shameful!!"

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA.

I have a KYC from the first day, not lagging platform. The only drawback I see on houbi rightnow is that some POW crypto are not there unfortunately, I hope that they will add it with time and don't support ETH on matic network (weth) until now. Problems on various exchanges I read always from people who do not want to complete KYC, also from people that they lost their 2FA. Bad reviews always come from people that do not know nothing about cryptocurrencies and exchanges."
