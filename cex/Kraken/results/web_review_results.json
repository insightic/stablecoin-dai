I deposited with Interac transfer a few days ago 3000 CAD into my Kraken account and received confirmation from both the bank and Interac that the money was collected. Ticket number #12566698. Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response. The only response was an auto-reply saying I would receive an email which I never did! My bank cannot recall the transfer so my money went to nowhere!

I can understand that my initial proof of address was rejected as part of the verification, but it has been a nightmare ever since I tried to correct that. Support reached out asking for this proof, which I gave. I have been ghosted for the past two weeks, and whenever I reach out to live support (which takes 3 hours) I am told the ticket is still open.I have asked to close the account because I found an alternative, and the support also says I should email my request to the same person who is ghosting me. It seems creating an account works like clockwork, but deleting one is practically impossible."

The other assets went up roughly the same, so I made about 50% profit.There are alot of transanction fees and I didn't realise the \"earn\" function was sent to third parties for their profit. But overall I made a profit and got my money back, so am satisfied."

As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team.This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."

Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange).

Reaching out to the live chat wasn't a fruitful idea - they have made me wait for 6 hours a few times and never got a response.

It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight.

Nevertheless, I was satisfied - I invested almost 5000 dollars in Bitcoin, now it was just a matter of waiting calmly for the exchange rate to rise. I was mistaken. On next day, I received an email from Kraken with information that my account will be closed. They gave me 72 hours to sell the BTC and withdraw the money. They provided no reason for such a decision! They wrote: \"For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action\"It is worth noting that these 72 hours fell on Saturday and Sunday, furthermore, it was Easter holidays.I sold the BTC I owned (they charged another fee) and transferred the money to my dollar account (another exchange).

Well, after doing all the necessary steps, it still did not recognise my documents and I was locked out of my account. Upon contacting Kraken support, the first support person says their \"devs\" are working on it. No reply for 5 days after I write back telling them to unlock my account. Then I'm told by another support person that the selfie was not recognised and can I do it again. Now \"person\" asks for my ID again, which I already uploaded and for some reson it doesn't recognise my ID and can't take the pic. Then I contact customer support again for the 4th time and the latest person tells me to try on another device and that my address has changed. IT HAS NOT! Been living in the same address for over 5 years. What is going on with Kraken support members? Are they just copy and pastiing replies and not reading what the customer is asking? Are they trying to lose customers, because if they are, they are doing a great job at it! AND, don't even try to call them... there is no answer. Phone lines are closed!"

It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight.

As of today, the funds are still being held by the platform. I have reached out to their support team multiple times, and all they have said is that they have a high volume of requests and that they have escalated my issue to a specialized team. The ticket number as follows: #12472530This is completely unacceptable. It feels like outright fraud to hold onto customers' money indefinitely with no resolution in sight. There are much better cryptocurrency exchanges out there that provide reliable service and timely transactions. Do yourself a favor and avoid Kraken - it's just not worth the headache and potential loss of your hard-earned money. Terrible experience overall."

Right, sends a message that my transfer (Sepa Instanta) is still in processing (although their website says that these transfers are carried out instantly) But in my case instantly I only have a nervous breakdown, the transaction itself has been in processing for half a day.I am sure that by the evening they will come up with a reason why the transaction will be blocked or again I will have to wait several days and answer my melas for several hours."

I complied immediately and sent all the documents they want. Afterwards I received a deposit of 1060 USDT, which first got stuck on confirming for a full day, and now all of a sudden is put ON HOLD. This money was sent for my newborn son and they are not crediting this to my account. Only response is they are working 24/7/365 and will receive an update soon as they are reviewing my account.

Nevertheless, all of a sudden my access to the account and the funds has been cut off. I have no idea if kraken has illegally appropriated my funds or what is going on. Their support desk is completely unresponsive, complaints are not taken serious at all, in most cases not even answered. If you have an account there, close it, take your money and run. I regret deeply entrusting them with my money, big mistake"

Upon contacting Kraken support, the first support person says their \"devs\" are working on it. No reply for 5 days after I write back telling them to unlock my account. Then I'm told by another support person that the selfie was not recognised and can I do it again. Now \"person\" asks for my ID again, which I already uploaded and for some reson it doesn't recognise my ID and can't take the pic. Then I contact customer support again for the 4th time and the latest person tells me to try on another device and that my address has changed. IT HAS NOT! Been living in the same address for over 5 years. What is going on with Kraken support members? Are they just copy and pastiing replies and not reading what the customer is asking? Are they trying to lose customers, because if they are, they are doing a great job at it! AND, don't even try to call them... there is no answer. Phone lines are closed!"

Then I logged my card so that I can purchase it through my card which I did. Money was in my Kraken account immediately. I went to transfer like before (Twice) but they only transferred $45 and the rest stayed in Kraken account. After the week end was over, I emailed them as to why the rest of funds are not transferred?. Reply was for SECURITY REASONS they wanted me to withdraw the amount back to my Bank and close my account. Asked WHAT WAS THE SECURITY REASON and they would not divulge any information. It took me 3 times and six days to finally activate the transfer. Funds are not in my account as yet let\u2019s hope they are by Thursday.I am putting in a complain to FCA regarding this as I believe Kraken owes me the answer of that SECURITY REASON is. Reading some reviews here I see quite a lot have suffered their SECURITY REASON Pallava."

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

Right, sends a message that my transfer (Sepa Instanta) is still in processing (although their website says that these transfers are carried out instantly) But in my case instantly I only have a nervous breakdown, the transaction itself has been in processing for half a day.I am sure that by the evening they will come up with a reason why the transaction will be blocked or again I will have to wait several days and answer my melas for several hours."

Upon contacting Kraken support, the first support person says their \"devs\" are working on it. No reply for 5 days after I write back telling them to unlock my account. Then I'm told by another support person that the selfie was not recognised and can I do it again. Now \"person\" asks for my ID again, which I already uploaded and for some reson it doesn't recognise my ID and can't take the pic. Then I contact customer support again for the 4th time and the latest person tells me to try on another device and that my address has changed. IT HAS NOT! Been living in the same address for over 5 years. What is going on with Kraken support members? Are they just copy and pastiing replies and not reading what the customer is asking? Are they trying to lose customers, because if they are, they are doing a great job at it! AND, don't even try to call them... there is no answer. Phone lines are closed!"

Reported some unauthorized transaction and that was it.  little to no response and their method of trying to contact them is such bs, that you can't report unless you're signed in, and I can't sign in.  It's easier to reset your password at the bank than with these guys.  For instance, you need a ticket number in order to fill out a form on the contact page, but right, can't get that unless you're signed in.I'm sorry but due to a computer crash some time back I don't have an account number.  And as far as public ID, all I have is my user ID which is/was taskatan2.I've submitted multiple emails, and even was able to talk to someone on the phone before that was suspended, so there must be some record of my multiple attempts to resolve this.Also, even though I did receive a couple responses from you, have never been given a \"ticket number\"And since you have emailed me, and you do show me as a customer, and you do have my DL Pic, how hard is it to email again, or call, me or ask for my DL pic again to prove I am who I say I am?  Because all the contact page nonsense, just isn't getting the job done."

Then I logged my card so that I can purchase it through my card which I did. Money was in my Kraken account immediately. I went to transfer like before (Twice) but they only transferred $45 and the rest stayed in Kraken account. After the week end was over, I emailed them as to why the rest of funds are not transferred?. Reply was for SECURITY REASONS they wanted me to withdraw the amount back to my Bank and close my account. Asked WHAT WAS THE SECURITY REASON and they would not divulge any information. It took me 3 times and six days to finally activate the transfer. Funds are not in my account as yet let\u2019s hope they are by Thursday.I am putting in a complain to FCA regarding this as I believe Kraken owes me the answer of that SECURITY REASON is. Reading some reviews here I see quite a lot have suffered their SECURITY REASON Pallava."

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

Then I'm told by another support person that the selfie was not recognised and can I do it again. Now \"person\" asks for my ID again, which I already uploaded and for some reson it doesn't recognise my ID and can't take the pic. Then I contact customer support again for the 4th time and the latest person tells me to try on another device and that my address has changed. IT HAS NOT! Been living in the same address for over 5 years. What is going on with Kraken support members? Are they just copy and pastiing replies and not reading what the customer is asking?

                "review": "I was referred to Kraken by a very good trader. Initially I transferred the funds via my Bank (Twice) and had no issues. Then I logged my card so that I can purchase it through my card which I did. Money was in my Kraken account immediately. I went to transfer like before (Twice) but they only transferred $45 and the rest stayed in Kraken account. After the week end was over, I emailed them as to why the rest of funds are not transferred?. Reply was for SECURITY REASONS they wanted me to withdraw the amount back to my Bank and close my account. Asked WHAT WAS THE SECURITY REASON and they would not divulge any information. It took me 3 times and six days to finally activate the transfer. Funds are not in my account as yet let\u2019s hope they are by Thursday.I am putting in a complain to FCA regarding this as I believe Kraken owes me the answer of that SECURITY REASON is. Reading some reviews here I see quite a lot have suffered their SECURITY REASON Pallava."

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

Reported some unauthorized transaction and that was it.  little to no response and their method of trying to contact them is such bs, that you can't report unless you're signed in, and I can't sign in.  It's easier to reset your password at the bank than with these guys.  For instance, you need a ticket number in order to fill out a form on the contact page, but right, can't get that unless you're signed in.I'm sorry but due to a computer crash some time back I don't have an account number.  And as far as public ID, all I have is my user ID which is/was taskatan2.I've submitted multiple emails, and even was able to talk to someone on the phone before that was suspended, so there must be some record of my multiple attempts to resolve this.Also, even though I did receive a couple responses from you, have never been given a \"ticket number\"And since you have emailed me, and you do show me as a customer, and you do have my DL Pic, how hard is it to email again, or call, me or ask for my DL pic again to prove I am who I say I am?  Because all the contact page nonsense, just isn't getting the job done.5/17   Still waiting on a response.  I've noticed a pattern here and that is, on your first complaint there is a response from Kraken sounding very sincere and forthright.  But upon updating my post wondering where is that earnest desire to make things right - crickets. I've pointed out the hysterical contradiction in acquiring a ticket number in order to contact you.  I need to be logged in to get one, but I cannot log in without one.  Insane. Eventually Trust Pilot will delete my post as they have done in the past.  I'll make another review, Kraken will again sincerely reply about their concern for my situation.  And that is that.This is my fourth update. if anybody is counting."

Reply was for SECURITY REASONS they wanted me to withdraw the amount back to my Bank and close my account. Asked WHAT WAS THE SECURITY REASON and they would not divulge any information. It took me 3 times and six days to finally activate the transfer. Funds are not in my account as yet let\u2019s hope they are by Thursday.I am putting in a complain to FCA regarding this as I believe Kraken owes me the answer of that SECURITY REASON is. Reading some reviews here I see quite a lot have suffered their SECURITY REASON Pallava."

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

It's easier to reset your password at the bank than with these guys.  For instance, you need a ticket number in order to fill out a form on the contact page, but right, can't get that unless you're signed in.I'm sorry but due to a computer crash some time back I don't have an account number.  And as far as public ID, all I have is my user ID which is/was taskatan2.I've submitted multiple emails, and even was able to talk to someone on the phone before that was suspended, so there must be some record of my multiple attempts to resolve this.Also, even though I did receive a couple responses from you, have never been given a \"ticket number\"And since you have emailed me, and you do show me as a customer, and you do have my DL Pic, how hard is it to email again, or call, me or ask for my DL pic again to prove I am who I say I am?  Because all the contact page nonsense, just isn't getting the job done.5/17   Still waiting on a response.  I've noticed a pattern here and that is, on your first complaint there is a response from Kraken sounding very sincere and forthright.  But upon updating my post wondering where is that earnest desire to make things right - crickets. I've pointed out the hysterical contradiction in acquiring a ticket number in order to contact you.  I need to be logged in to get one, but I cannot log in without one.  Insane. Eventually Trust Pilot will delete my post as they have done in the past.  I'll make another review, Kraken will again sincerely reply about their concern for my situation.  And that is that.This is my fourth update. if anybody is counting."

Then I logged my card so that I can purchase it through my card which I did. Money was in my Kraken account immediately. I went to transfer like before (Twice) but they only transferred $45 and the rest stayed in Kraken account. After the week end was over, I emailed them as to why the rest of funds are not transferred?. Reply was for SECURITY REASONS they wanted me to withdraw the amount back to my Bank and close my account. Asked WHAT WAS THE SECURITY REASON and they would not divulge any information. It took me 3 times and six days to finally activate the transfer. Funds are not in my account as yet let\u2019s hope they are by Thursday.I am putting in a complain to FCA regarding this as I believe Kraken owes me the answer of that SECURITY REASON is.

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

It's easier to reset your password at the bank than with these guys.  For instance, you need a ticket number in order to fill out a form on the contact page, but right, can't get that unless you're signed in.I'm sorry but due to a computer crash some time back I don't have an account number.  And as far as public ID, all I have is my user ID which is/was taskatan2.I've submitted multiple emails, and even was able to talk to someone on the phone before that was suspended, so there must be some record of my multiple attempts to resolve this.Also, even though I did receive a couple responses from you, have never been given a \"ticket number\"And since you have emailed me, and you do show me as a customer, and you do have my DL Pic, how hard is it to email again, or call, me or ask for my DL pic again to prove I am who I say I am?  Because all the contact page nonsense, just isn't getting the job done.5/17   Still waiting on a response.  I've noticed a pattern here and that is, on your first complaint there is a response from Kraken sounding very sincere and forthright.  But upon updating my post wondering where is that earnest desire to make things right - crickets. I've pointed out the hysterical contradiction in acquiring a ticket number in order to contact you.  I need to be logged in to get one, but I cannot log in without one.  Insane. Eventually Trust Pilot will delete my post as they have done in the past.  I'll make another review, Kraken will again sincerely reply about their concern for my situation.  And that is that.This is my fourth update. if anybody is counting."

                "review": "I opened an account with Kraken on 8 Apr 2024. For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

After a while they told me they were closing my account for 'security reasons' and they would return my money sometime in the future???So why wasn't I informed my account was closed before I made a deposit? I could still login prior to doing so.Absolutely disgraceful. No wonder they have such shockingly poor reviews here. So many better exchanges out there to go with. Thieves."

Then I logged my card so that I can purchase it through my card which I did. Money was in my Kraken account immediately. I went to transfer like before (Twice) but they only transferred $45 and the rest stayed in Kraken account. After the week end was over, I emailed them as to why the rest of funds are not transferred?. Reply was for SECURITY REASONS they wanted me to withdraw the amount back to my Bank and close my account. Asked WHAT WAS THE SECURITY REASON and they would not divulge any information. It took me 3 times and six days to finally activate the transfer. Funds are not in my account as yet let\u2019s hope they are by Thursday.I am putting in a complain to FCA regarding this as I believe Kraken owes me the answer of that SECURITY REASON is. Reading some reviews here I see quite a lot have suffered their SECURITY REASON Pallava.24/05/24Kraken is asking for ticket number but they should look to their support considering they have my name.Furthermore I have withdrawn my money and arguing with them to refund charges I incurred in transferring the funds back into my bank on the basis that they instigate to close my account without giving any valid reason. Security Reason is not a valid reason. STRONGLY ADVISE NOT TO USE THIS COMPANY"

Reported some unauthorized transaction and that was it.  little to no response and their method of trying to contact them is such bs, that you can't report unless you're signed in, and I can't sign in.  It's easier to reset your password at the bank than with these guys.  For instance, you need a ticket number in order to fill out a form on the contact page, but right, can't get that unless you're signed in.I'm sorry but due to a computer crash some time back I don't have an account number.  And as far as public ID, all I have is my user ID which is/was taskatan2.I've submitted multiple emails, and even was able to talk to someone on the phone before that was suspended, so there must be some record of my multiple attempts to resolve this.Also, even though I did receive a couple responses from you, have never been given a \"ticket number\"And since you have emailed me, and you do show me as a customer, and you do have my DL Pic, how hard is it to email again, or call, me or ask for my DL pic again to prove I am who I say I am?  Because all the contact page nonsense, just isn't getting the job done.5/17   Still waiting on a response.  I've noticed a pattern here and that is, on your first complaint there is a response from Kraken sounding very sincere and forthright.  But upon updating my post wondering where is that earnest desire to make things right - crickets. I've pointed out the hysterical contradiction in acquiring a ticket number in order to contact you.  I need to be logged in to get one, but I cannot log in without one.  Insane. Eventually Trust Pilot will delete my post as they have done in the past.  I'll make another review, Kraken will again sincerely reply about their concern for my situation.  And that is that.This is my fourth update. if anybody is counting."

Right, sends a message that my transfer (Sepa Instanta) is still in processing (although their website says that these transfers are carried out instantly) But in my case instantly I only have a nervous breakdown, the transaction itself has been in processing for half a day.I am sure that by the evening they will come up with a reason why the transaction will be blocked or again I will have to wait several days and answer my melas for several hours."

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

For unknown reason, it was closed on the next day before I even had a chance to use it and was informed that I will not be allowed to open another one. No explanation given due to their \u201csecurity\u201d reason. Clearly, the only crime I have committed was to open an account with them. The worst was yet to come. Under such circumstance, one would assume that it is normal for a crypto exchange to refund a deposit immediately. Instead, I was forced to remain persistent with my follow ups nearly every day for more than five weeks before they decided to pay me back!  Isn\u2019t it odd that while deposits are credited within one day, when it comes to payment or withdrawal, they are really good in dragging their feet! Although the Support team was helpful, they were restricted within their own boundary. By the way, don\u2019t bother writing to the new CEO for help because he still has not learnt the fundamental manners of replying to his email yet. By comparison, other providers like Binance, ByBit and Coinbase may charge marginally higher fee but they are, by far, more professional than Kraken. After such an appalling experience, do you think I will recommend anyone to open an account with Kraken? Not a chance! Stay clear of this mob! They operate like scammers!"

So, maybe it's been long enough and I'll get that response, or who, knows, I'll get some satisfaction.6/3   Yes, I did receive something from trust pilot/you on May 7.  It is more from trust pilot than from you however informing me of my lack of authenticity. But  I do see your reply to this post  in my gmail from yesterday @ 8pm 6/2.   I still cannot log in to my account.  Thanks for responding.6/4  The correct answer is NO.  Have not received any emails since 4/2.  I fill out the link where I'm supposed to get a code to reset password, and I never get an email.  I check spam, gmail, etc.6/5  Where'd you go?  this proves my postulation, that they will respond to an initial post, but any follow up never happens.

Website jumps up and down and date/time selectors keep opening when entering text in address text fields etc.Update 2024-06-07:As they comment below, I should create a support ticket. But they forgot to notice, that it's almost impossible to create such a support ticket as described above. I have given up and moved my assets somewhere else already. Way to lose a customer"

A HUGE RED FLAG!They closed my account for ***no reason*** after I made few test transactions (~AUD 75) deposit and withdraw back and forth to my Revolut bank account to see how things worked. Even when I escalated to their Reddit support, they still wanted to close and asked me not to register with them again in the future.Absolutely the worst.

We apologize for the delay, rest assured our specialists are working diligently on your ticket and will respond via email as soon as possible. If you have any additional questions please continue to communicate via email.  Please be patient our team will contact you once their investigation is completed\u201d. Blah blah blah. No one has responded for 4 days. Not even an acknowledgement of receipt of my email. It is entirely an automated system. Their phone number is supposedly overworked and shut down. You cannot speak to a human. There are no answers. If they meant their response here (which was more than 3 hours ago) I would have heard something. Even just an email stating they are still working on it. Which is all I have requested over 40 times. NOTHING. At all cost AVOID KRAKEN!!!!!I was a new user. I was trading and unfortunately losing\u2026. After less than 3 days I received an email from kraken stating they were closing my account within 72 hours and they were unable to provide any explanation and advised me to sell any currencies and withdraw all funds asap because once they closed my account I would no longer have access. Therefore I did exactly as told. Sold my crypto and made a cash withdrawal via e-transfer as I had been using that method for deposits. The first withdrawal was cancelled by kraken two hours later. So I verified all of my information and then attempted a second withdrawal. That was 4 days ago. I have been in contact with customer support, provided all of the requested verification documents which they confirmed receiving. That was three days ago. To date I have sent an additional 40 emails requesting information because my money says it has been withdrawn however I have not received a cent. I created another \u201cticket\u201d asking about my withdrawal and was told I have no funds in my account to be withdrawn and that the withdrawal I did do was complete. Still customer support will not respond. Their FAQ regarding withdrawals all state maximum of 72 hours to complete in rare cases. So even if mine is a rare case my withdrawal should be complete by now. Also my account is still open. It still states all services are enabled and for sh*ts and giggles I attempted to make another deposit. And they accepted it. So they have not closed my account. But they have managed to STEAL my money. My next step is to report them to any and all agencies that I can. Ticket number 12931579. For reference"

Clicking link sent by e-mail only shows an almost blank page saying that I succesfully confirmed the login. But there is no other menu options. Going back to front page just asks for login again. Apparently one has to open the link in the same tab. Otherwise the website doesn't know where to redirect you. Insanely stupidly designed.3. Trying to contact support about the login issue is almost impossible. Asks for all kinds of meaningless information in order to just complain about their broken website. How is it going to help by uploading proofs/documents, when I only want to inform that the website is broken?4. Trying to fill out another form to change my address etc., I am again being asked to fill out of lot of details and upload proof. Finally clicking the submit-button only says something went wrong and then it's impossible to retry5. In general it's a nightmare to fill out forms. Website jumps up and down and date/time selectors keep opening when entering text in address text fields etc.Update 2024-06-07:As they comment below, I should create a support ticket. But they forgot to notice, that it's almost impossible to create such a support ticket as described above. I have given up and moved my assets somewhere else already. Way to lose a customer"

I should have checked Trustpilot before I went ahead to open an account with them. Yes, 1.5 STAR. A HUGE RED FLAG!They closed my account for ***no reason*** after I made few test transactions (~AUD 75) deposit and withdraw back and forth to my Revolut bank account to see how things worked. Even when I escalated to their Reddit support, they still wanted to close and asked me not to register with them again in the future.Absolutely the worst. Do not do business with them, they don't need customers."

Positive feedback highlights these aspects as key strengths, suggesting that the company is perceived as trustworthy and cooperative with regulatory bodies. However, negative reviews point out the repetitive call-to-action phrases and multiple links, which suggest the presence of bot-generated content, raising concerns about the authenticity and personalization of interactions. This repetitive and automated nature of content could potentially undermine user trust and satisfaction. To improve, the company should consider reducing the reliance on automated content and enhancing the personalization of their communications to foster a more genuine and engaging user experience. Further investigation into the balance between automation and human interaction could provide deeper insights into optimizing user engagement.",

                "review": "I created an account with them a few days ago, deposited money multiple times and bought USDT in two transactions with no issues. They happily charged me for the buy transactions. But then when I tried to withdraw the funds, they put it on hold. The next day after I contacted them, they told me that they're closing my account \"for security reasons\", and I have to convert back to AUD and transfer it back to my bank account. They happily charged me again for the conversion. I lost 5% of the money in the process, for literally having received no services, and having incurred a fair bit of stress waiting to hear what happened to my USDT withdrawal.Needless to say that the withdrawal of AUD out of Kraken was also delayed for a while, forcing me to get in contact with their support multiple times.Just stay away from them if you care about your money and mental health."

After waiting till June 24 i opened a ticket to claim my money with them. Instead of helping they just send my money back to my bank account, informed me to sell my btc into euro and transfer back too. Without any explanation they closed my account within 72 hours, treating me like a suspicious user or so while i am just a normal total reliable person, never problems or a criminal record.

That said, they refuse to provide accurate information, and skirt Canadian law by giving bogus information as they hope people won't look up the law. Every time they did so, I called them out on them and provided links to the government websites (we have multiple for my province). Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks. This in and of itself is alarming, considering they handle money. I am not surprised that the reviews here average below 1.5 stars."

That said, they refuse to provide accurate information, and skirt Canadian law by giving bogus information as they hope people won't look up the law. Every time they did so, I called them out on them and provided links to the government websites (we have multiple for my province). Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks. This in and of itself is alarming, considering they handle money. I am not surprised that the reviews here average below 1.5 stars."

I did all that. Then I tried to buy some crypto and they said I was not allowed and to contact support so I did. They replied that they were closing my account but would not say why and they were holding my money for a week before they would release it. Sounds like a fraudulent company getting free loans and stealing money and hiding behind \"laws\" to get away with it. You have been warned, do not open an account with these scammers."

That said, they refuse to provide accurate information, and skirt Canadian law by giving bogus information as they hope people won't look up the law. Every time they did so, I called them out on them and provided links to the government websites (we have multiple for my province). Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks. This in and of itself is alarming, considering they handle money. I am not surprised that the reviews here average below 1.5 stars."

Every time they did so, I called them out on them and provided links to the government websites (we have multiple for my province). Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks.

                "review": "Opened an account in Kraken Pro with no issues at all. Then, I made the first transfer from an Australian bank account through Osko, and the funds got credited almost instantaneously.In view of this, tried to top up with a larger deposit. This time the transaction did not go through. I contacted Kraken who opened a ticket to investigate. A few hours later I received an email saying that my 2nd deposit was going to be reverted and they were going to close my account within 72 hours. So I had to withdraw all my funds within that time! Of course, no explanation was given. While the second deposit was reverted successfully, I'm still waiting for the withdrawal request to reach my bank account. Kraken claims that it should be nearly instantaneous when using Osko. However, it seems this is the case only when they receive the deposit, not when you withdraw it! I'm still waiting for my funds to be returned (ticket # 13181345). Furthermore, sick of emails back and forth for something that should be that simple. Who knows if the funds will be returned, they claim that after 72 hours I won't be able to reach customer support any longer. All in all, terrible experience. Don't even want to think about those who hold large sums in that exchange. They can close your account in a whim or hold your funds until they want, if ever, to send them back to you. Stay away from Kraken, there are many other options in the market"

Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks.

                "review": "Opened an account in Kraken Pro with no issues at all. Then, I made the first transfer from an Australian bank account through Osko, and the funds got credited almost instantaneously.In view of this, tried to top up with a larger deposit. This time the transaction did not go through. I contacted Kraken who opened a ticket to investigate. A few hours later I received an email saying that my 2nd deposit was going to be reverted and they were going to close my account within 72 hours. So I had to withdraw all my funds within that time! Of course, no explanation was given. While the second deposit was reverted successfully, I'm still waiting for the withdrawal request to reach my bank account. Kraken claims that it should be nearly instantaneous when using Osko. However, it seems this is the case only when they receive the deposit, not when you withdraw it! I'm still waiting for my funds to be returned (ticket # 13181345). Furthermore, sick of emails back and forth for something that should be that simple. Who knows if the funds will be returned, they claim that after 72 hours I won't be able to reach customer support any longer. All in all, terrible experience. Don't even want to think about those who hold large sums in that exchange. They can close your account in a whim or hold your funds until they want, if ever, to send them back to you. Stay away from Kraken, there are many other options in the market"

Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks.

Then, I made the first transfer from an Australian bank account through Osko, and the funds got credited almost instantaneously.In view of this, tried to top up with a larger deposit. This time the transaction did not go through. I contacted Kraken who opened a ticket to investigate. A few hours later I received an email saying that my 2nd deposit was going to be reverted and they were going to close my account within 72 hours. So I had to withdraw all my funds within that time! Of course, no explanation was given. While the second deposit was reverted successfully, I'm still waiting for the withdrawal request to reach my bank account. Kraken claims that it should be nearly instantaneous when using Osko. However, it seems this is the case only when they receive the deposit, not when you withdraw it! I'm still waiting for my funds to be returned (ticket # 13181345). Furthermore, sick of emails back and forth for something that should be that simple. Who knows if the funds will be returned, they claim that after 72 hours I won't be able to reach customer support any longer. All in all, terrible experience. Don't even want to think about those who hold large sums in that exchange. They can close your account in a whim or hold your funds until they want, if ever, to send them back to you. Stay away from Kraken, there are many other options in the market"

Every time they did so, I called them out on them and provided links to the government websites (we have multiple for my province). Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks. This in and of itself is alarming, considering they handle money. I am not surprised that the reviews here average below 1.5 stars."

                "review": "Opened an account in Kraken Pro with no issues at all. Then, I made the first transfer from an Australian bank account through Osko, and the funds got credited almost instantaneously.In view of this, tried to top up with a larger deposit. This time the transaction did not go through. I contacted Kraken who opened a ticket to investigate. A few hours later I received an email saying that my 2nd deposit was going to be reverted and they were going to close my account within 72 hours. So I had to withdraw all my funds within that time! Of course, no explanation was given. While the second deposit was reverted successfully, I'm still waiting for the withdrawal request to reach my bank account. Kraken claims that it should be nearly instantaneous when using Osko. However, it seems this is the case only when they receive the deposit, not when you withdraw it! I'm still waiting for my funds to be returned (ticket # 13181345). Furthermore, sick of emails back and forth for something that should be that simple. Who knows if the funds will be returned, they claim that after 72 hours I won't be able to reach customer support any longer. All in all, terrible experience. Don't even want to think about those who hold large sums in that exchange. They can close your account in a whim or hold your funds until they want, if ever, to send them back to you. Stay away from Kraken, there are many other options in the market"

I did all that. Then I tried to buy some crypto and they said I was not allowed and to contact support so I did. They replied that they were closing my account but would not say why and they were holding my money for a week before they would release it.

That said, they refuse to provide accurate information, and skirt Canadian law by giving bogus information as they hope people won't look up the law. Every time they did so, I called them out on them and provided links to the government websites (we have multiple for my province). Furthermore, I am concerned that their customer support is in Ireland, since they are dealing with money. This means that if something happens to your money as a Canadian or American, they couldn't face our local laws. In other words, this is a security risk considering that some people invest thousands of dollars.Lastly, their reply ranges from 3-5 weeks. This in and of itself is alarming, considering they handle money. I am not surprised that the reviews here average below 1.5 stars."

                "review": "Opened an account in Kraken Pro with no issues at all. Then, I made the first transfer from an Australian bank account through Osko, and the funds got credited almost instantaneously.In view of this, tried to top up with a larger deposit. This time the transaction did not go through. I contacted Kraken who opened a ticket to investigate. A few hours later I received an email saying that my 2nd deposit was going to be reverted and they were going to close my account within 72 hours. So I had to withdraw all my funds within that time! Of course, no explanation was given. While the second deposit was reverted successfully, I'm still waiting for the withdrawal request to reach my bank account. Kraken claims that it should be nearly instantaneous when using Osko. However, it seems this is the case only when they receive the deposit, not when you withdraw it! I'm still waiting for my funds to be returned (ticket # 13181345). Furthermore, sick of emails back and forth for something that should be that simple. Who knows if the funds will be returned, they claim that after 72 hours I won't be able to reach customer support any longer. All in all, terrible experience. Don't even want to think about those who hold large sums in that exchange. They can close your account in a whim or hold your funds until they want, if ever, to send them back to you. Stay away from Kraken, there are many other options in the market"

After waiting till June 24 i opened a ticket to claim my money with them. Instead of helping they just send my money back to my bank account, informed me to sell my btc into euro and transfer back too. Without any explanation they closed my account within 72 hours, treating me like a suspicious user or so while i am just a normal total reliable person, never problems or a criminal record.

                "review": "Opened an account in Kraken Pro with no issues at all. Then, I made the first transfer from an Australian bank account through Osko, and the funds got credited almost instantaneously.In view of this, tried to top up with a larger deposit. This time the transaction did not go through. I contacted Kraken who opened a ticket to investigate. A few hours later I received an email saying that my 2nd deposit was going to be reverted and they were going to close my account within 72 hours. So I had to withdraw all my funds within that time! Of course, no explanation was given. While the second deposit was reverted successfully, I'm still waiting for the withdrawal request to reach my bank account. Kraken claims that it should be nearly instantaneous when using Osko. However, it seems this is the case only when they receive the deposit, not when you withdraw it! I'm still waiting for my funds to be returned (ticket # 13181345). Furthermore, sick of emails back and forth for something that should be that simple. Who knows if the funds will be returned, they claim that after 72 hours I won't be able to reach customer support any longer. All in all, terrible experience. Don't even want to think about those who hold large sums in that exchange. They can close your account in a whim or hold your funds until they want, if ever, to send them back to you. Stay away from Kraken, there are many other options in the market"

After waiting till June 24 i opened a ticket to claim my money with them. Instead of helping they just send my money back to my bank account, informed me to sell my btc into euro and transfer back too. Without any explanation they closed my account within 72 hours, treating me like a suspicious user or so while i am just a normal total reliable person, never problems or a criminal record.

                "review": "Had an amazing experience initially with them. Then they closed my account since I am EU-citizen. That's totally understandable and okay. This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds. Will update my review after I receive my funds (hopefully)."

This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds. Will update my review after I receive my funds (hopefully)."

This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds.

This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds. Will update my review after I receive my funds (hopefully)."

I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds.

I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds.

This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds.

This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds.

                "review": "Had an amazing experience initially with them. Then they closed my account since I am EU-citizen. That's totally understandable and okay. This happened already 3 months ago. They gave me a possibility to withdraw my cryptos (one month after suspension). Though they still don't give me a possibility to withdraw the fiat ($1.5k). I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that. It's a nice exchange, though there is a huge possibility your funds will get stuck and you will wait countless days without access to your funds. Will update my review after I receive my funds (hopefully)."

I just don't understand what is the problem to convert fiat to USDT and allow me to withdraw. I've tried to contact them multiple times, their payment team is working on it. They don't even provide any ETA on the case. What are they working on? Just convert the fiat and give me my funds back. Ticked ID: \u202f12598428I strongly advice anyone who is considering this exchange to use for trading - don't do that.

I am struggling to get anything out of the customer support, nobody replies to my mails for weeks and if I get a reply, it is a loop to start the reverification process again just to end up in the same place.

I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

Further investigation into the specific causes of these transparency and reliability issues could provide actionable insights for targeted improvements.",

But I never bought it at that price! There's a \u00a350 difference, and this isn't even a fee because my purchase details already show a \u00a323.49 fee. That \u00a350 difference, plus the actual fee of \u00a323.49, makes no sense. I don\u2019t know where this came from, as I would never have bought at that price. It's very frustrating because I didn't make the purchase at that price, yet they recorded it as if I did."

Still no confirmation of funds received.Now nobody can find my deposit, a d another request for a significant cash deposit. Now I make a request asking us thus the last cash payment or is there more to come. I MAID a lot of noise to numerous people.

Today I tried all day to use lightening on several transactions but always had to go back to standard btc process.  I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

When crypto is sent withdrawn to a wallet , in the withdrawal wallet it shows all incoming crypto until the hash is solved in the network and the money is then sent to the withdrawal wallet.

That \u00a350 difference, plus the actual fee of \u00a323.49, makes no sense. I don\u2019t know where this came from, as I would never have bought at that price. It's very frustrating because I didn't make the purchase at that price, yet they recorded it as if I did."

Still no confirmation of funds received.Now nobody can find my deposit, a d another request for a significant cash deposit. Now I make a request asking us thus the last cash payment or is there more to come. I MAID a lot of noise to numerous people.  Next thing I receive back my all my LUSD,  but they converted the coin portion of my transfer to LUSD.

Today I tried all day to use lightening on several transactions but always had to go back to standard btc process.  I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

However, negative reviews point to critical issues like market manipulation and difficulties with withdrawals, indicating areas where the company may need to improve transparency and reliability.

To enhance user satisfaction, the company should focus on addressing these negative aspects, possibly through better communication, improved withdrawal processes, and stricter market regulations.",

                "review": "I've been using Kraken for some years and always loved the Interface and User experience. That was until I had to reverify my German Account because of some legal changes in Europe. The process itself was very smooth. I checked some boxes, uploaded a document, did a web identification. And then nothing happened. My account was frozen for a week. After my wife did go through the same process and got verified within hours I became sceptical and wrote a ticket. ...After writing SEVERAL Tickets (I know you shouldn't but the standardized answers did neither explain nor do anything) some lady at least wrote there was a problem with my name between my account and my passport (probably because I have several names). She allegedly demanded a new web assessment and I had to wait a bit more until it would be open. This was about one and a half months ago. I wrote the support again and again, got no explanations except 'it takes more time' or no answers at all. I even installed Krakens App to get live Support via chat but instead of helping the advisers there only reminded my contact persons to support me which they still didn't. Now automated reminders are coming that I still need to re-verify my qccount or otherwise my orders will be deleted. My account has been frozen for two months and my relationsship with Kraken went from 'best Crypto Broker of all time' to 'worst broker you could fall for'. Now I have to find another good broker which takes time but is at least doable whereas no one knows if my account can be used in two months from now again if ever. Somehow the process has been stuck, there might be a technical failure but nobody at Kraken seems to even care or ask themselves what went wrong, not to mention an apology for this mess. I mean how hard can it be to reopen a web assessment process which took two minutes initiate? Now it takes months to open it for a second time and nobody asks why? My account apparently has been stuck in a technical glitch or whatever but I won't. Thank you Kraken for those years but this is a ridiculous waste of my time. For all those thinking about using Kraken: Better don't if you don't want to risk your assets being stuck in an exchange you can't use. Probably some poor soul will write here again that my problem is being processed. And then again nothing will happen. Don't let them fool you! (If I'm wrong I will delete this gladly and immediately.)"

Today I tried all day to use lightening on several transactions but always had to go back to standard btc process.  I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

                "review": "I've been using Kraken for some years and always loved the Interface and User experience. That was until I had to reverify my German Account because of some legal changes in Europe. The process itself was very smooth. I checked some boxes, uploaded a document, did a web identification. And then nothing happened. My account was frozen for a week. After my wife did go through the same process and got verified within hours I became sceptical and wrote a ticket. ...After writing SEVERAL Tickets (I know you shouldn't but the standardized answers did neither explain nor do anything) some lady at least wrote there was a problem with my name between my account and my passport (probably because I have several names). She allegedly demanded a new web assessment and I had to wait a bit more until it would be open. This was about one and a half months ago. I wrote the support again and again, got no explanations except 'it takes more time' or no answers at all. I even installed Krakens App to get live Support via chat but instead of helping the advisers there only reminded my contact persons to support me which they still didn't. Now automated reminders are coming that I still need to re-verify my qccount or otherwise my orders will be deleted. My account has been frozen for two months and my relationsship with Kraken went from 'best Crypto Broker of all time' to 'worst broker you could fall for'. Now I have to find another good broker which takes time but is at least doable whereas no one knows if my account can be used in two months from now again if ever. Somehow the process has been stuck, there might be a technical failure but nobody at Kraken seems to even care or ask themselves what went wrong, not to mention an apology for this mess. I mean how hard can it be to reopen a web assessment process which took two minutes initiate? Now it takes months to open it for a second time and nobody asks why? My account apparently has been stuck in a technical glitch or whatever but I won't. Thank you Kraken for those years but this is a ridiculous waste of my time. For all those thinking about using Kraken: Better don't if you don't want to risk your assets being stuck in an exchange you can't use. Probably some poor soul will write here again that my problem is being processed. And then again nothing will happen. Don't let them fool you! (If I'm wrong I will delete this gladly and immediately.)"

Today I tried all day to use lightening on several transactions but always had to go back to standard btc process.  I withdrew $145 from my btc account and by time it reached its destination an hour later it was $37.00 . There responded with I should pay more attention to the fee and yeah I get it but never in a million years would I ever expect a $108 fee. If they flagged it when it gets that high so we look more closely or put it in dollars do it\u2019s easier to decipher. Of course I asked to speak with a supervisor but have yet to hear from anyone. I probably bought and traded $2000 in btc the last two days alone . I know that\u2019s nothing to them but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to me.

She provided all details and they never replied back . Just two days ago the money transfer in the app said failed and a new transaction was made by kraken saying transferred but the money never came to me nor was it returned back to her . When crypto is sent withdrawn to a wallet , in the withdrawal wallet it shows all incoming crypto until the hash is solved in the network and the money is then sent to the withdrawal wallet. In theory the money was held by the platform kraken and was neither sent nor returned and the only name for that is stealing ."

Positive reviews are characterized by their focus on genuine ecosystem updates, technical advancements, and the inclusion of specific URLs, which indicate authenticity and progress. In contrast, negative reviews often highlight repetitive patterns, generic phrasing, and potential manipulation schemes, suggesting dissatisfaction and possible fraudulent activities. The main themes revolve around authenticity and technical focus versus potential manipulation and generic content. To improve, it is crucial to address the concerns of manipulation and generic content in negative reviews, ensuring transparency and genuine engagement, while continuing to emphasize and communicate technical advancements and ecosystem updates.

The only thing I kept hearing from them is that someone from the Specialist Team will email me with an update.  I never received any emails from that team.  When I asked to speak to a Manager they said that was not possible and would be a total waste of my time.A total of 10 tickets were created by the Support team but I still got no response.  My level of frustration with this company and its staff is through the roof and it has created immense stress for me.I would not recommend this company to anyone.

When I asked to speak to a Manager they said that was not possible and would be a total waste of my time.A total of 10 tickets were created by the Support team but I still got no response.  My level of frustration with this company and its staff is through the roof and it has created immense stress for me.I would not recommend this company to anyone.

The support team could not provide me with any answers.  They all use a script to deal with client objections.  The only thing I kept hearing from them is that someone from the Specialist Team will email me with an update.  I never received any emails from that team.  When I asked to speak to a Manager they said that was not possible and would be a total waste of my time.A total of 10 tickets were created by the Support team but I still got no response.  My level of frustration with this company and its staff is through the roof and it has created immense stress for me.I would not recommend this company to anyone.  Be warned before you send your hard earned money to these people.  They do not care about their customers at all."

Negative feedback frequently mentions issues such as account blocking, locked withdrawals, and potential Ponzi-like tactics, indicating a lack of confidence in regulatory compliance and financial security. Conversely, positive reviews emphasize democratized financial access, secure investments, and strong customer support, suggesting some users appreciate the platform's innovative approach and fintech leadership. The divide between user trust and skepticism suggests a need for improved transparency and communication regarding regulatory compliance and security measures. To enhance user satisfaction, the platform should address these critical issues, focusing on resolving customer service problems and mitigating P2P fraud concerns.",

I am new to Crypto but decided to use this platform as i believed it was regulated and would be safe.I deposited GBP3,800 in USDT in 2 UK Bank Card transactions. After 72 hours (which was the time it took my UK bank to clear payment) they closed my account without any explanation and requested i covert coins to USD and withdraw from Kraken platform within 72 hours. The problem is that the only avenue to withdraw funds available on the platform is to use 3rd party wire however, this is only available to US Citizens, of which i am not.I received email from Kraken Support requesting a Bank Statement in order for them to make payment back to my UK account. It has been 48 hours since i provided this information and so far no feedback and my funds remain trapped in an un-usable Kraken account...........i am now getting worried... is this another scam company???Yesterday, i opened up a Dispute with my UK bank and hope this can be escalated.Update 31-Oct.......Payment method was added to the Krakan Page to allow my withdrawal in USD back to my UK bank. The transfer was completed howver, 8 hours later and funds NOT YET arrived to my bank. All bank details were correct and checked multiple times before transaction. If in fact funds do reach my UK bank account i will update further. Ticket # 14054173"

They will ignore you and tell you to wait and wait and wait. Then suddenly your account will be closed your account for no reason. They won't give you money. Instead they make you PAY MORE FEES to exchange the crpyto back to FIAT. Then another fee to send it back to your bank.Check out the reviews they do this A LOT. Scamming people money so they can make the buy and force them to sell and they profit 2 sets of fees. And the customer service is horrible and usless. They cannot do anything, they have no control to help over anything. They ask for your ticket to help, but they can't look or do anything! The real support just hides behind emails. What is the point in having customer service if you can't actually help customer? Wait wait wait for an email from our specialists wow so insightful. YOU HAVE TO WAIT 1 HOUR ON HOLD TO CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST TO GET TOLD THIS. It took about 18 hours in total after they froze my crypto to get an email saying they were closing my account.I asked for a refund on the \u00a330 fees I paid since they refused to transfer my crypto. Their answer \"Please note that we are unable to waive or give back the standard fees charged in our platform to use our services.\"I didn't use any fees or services because they refused to send my crypto and forced me to sell it so they can profit more money. My money stayed in their bank and they did nothing and want to charge you \u00a330 for the pleasure of closing your account and do nothing. They will do you dirty and still try to scam every cent they can out of you. DO NOT USE THIS EXCHANGE. SCAM SCAM SCAM."

I am new to Crypto but decided to use this platform as i believed it was regulated and would be safe.I deposited GBP3,800 in USDT in 2 UK Bank Card transactions. After 72 hours (which was the time it took my UK bank to clear payment) they closed my account without any explanation and requested i covert coins to USD and withdraw from Kraken platform within 72 hours. The problem is that the only avenue to withdraw funds available on the platform is to use 3rd party wire however, this is only available to US Citizens, of which i am not.I received email from Kraken Support requesting a Bank Statement in order for them to make payment back to my UK account. It has been 48 hours since i provided this information and so far no feedback and my funds remain trapped in an un-usable Kraken account...........i am now getting worried... is this another scam company???Yesterday, i opened up a Dispute with my UK bank and hope this can be escalated.Update 31-Oct.......Payment method was added to the Krakan Page to allow my withdrawal in USD back to my UK bank. The transfer was completed howver, 8 hours later and funds NOT YET arrived to my bank. All bank details were correct and checked multiple times before transaction.

They will ignore you and tell you to wait and wait and wait. Then suddenly your account will be closed your account for no reason. They won't give you money. Instead they make you PAY MORE FEES to exchange the crpyto back to FIAT. Then another fee to send it back to your bank.Check out the reviews they do this A LOT. Scamming people money so they can make the buy and force them to sell and they profit 2 sets of fees. And the customer service is horrible and usless. They cannot do anything, they have no control to help over anything. They ask for your ticket to help, but they can't look or do anything! The real support just hides behind emails. What is the point in having customer service if you can't actually help customer? Wait wait wait for an email from our specialists wow so insightful. YOU HAVE TO WAIT 1 HOUR ON HOLD TO CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST TO GET TOLD THIS. It took about 18 hours in total after they froze my crypto to get an email saying they were closing my account.I asked for a refund on the \u00a330 fees I paid since they refused to transfer my crypto. Their answer \"Please note that we are unable to waive or give back the standard fees charged in our platform to use our services.\"I didn't use any fees or services because they refused to send my crypto and forced me to sell it so they can profit more money. My money stayed in their bank and they did nothing and want to charge you \u00a330 for the pleasure of closing your account and do nothing. They will do you dirty and still try to scam every cent they can out of you. DO NOT USE THIS EXCHANGE. SCAM SCAM SCAM."

I am new to Crypto but decided to use this platform as i believed it was regulated and would be safe.I deposited GBP3,800 in USDT in 2 UK Bank Card transactions. After 72 hours (which was the time it took my UK bank to clear payment) they closed my account without any explanation and requested i covert coins to USD and withdraw from Kraken platform within 72 hours. The problem is that the only avenue to withdraw funds available on the platform is to use 3rd party wire however, this is only available to US Citizens, of which i am not.I received email from Kraken Support requesting a Bank Statement in order for them to make payment back to my UK account. It has been 48 hours since i provided this information and so far no feedback and my funds remain trapped in an un-usable Kraken account...........i am now getting worried... is this another scam company???Yesterday, i opened up a Dispute with my UK bank and hope this can be escalated.Update 31-Oct.......Payment method was added to the Krakan Page to allow my withdrawal in USD back to my UK bank. The transfer was completed howver, 8 hours later and funds NOT YET arrived to my bank. All bank details were correct and checked multiple times before transaction. If in fact funds do reach my UK bank account i will update further. Ticket # 14054173"

They will ignore you and tell you to wait and wait and wait. Then suddenly your account will be closed your account for no reason. They won't give you money. Instead they make you PAY MORE FEES to exchange the crpyto back to FIAT. Then another fee to send it back to your bank.Check out the reviews they do this A LOT. Scamming people money so they can make the buy and force them to sell and they profit 2 sets of fees. And the customer service is horrible and usless. They cannot do anything, they have no control to help over anything. They ask for your ticket to help, but they can't look or do anything! The real support just hides behind emails. What is the point in having customer service if you can't actually help customer? Wait wait wait for an email from our specialists wow so insightful. YOU HAVE TO WAIT 1 HOUR ON HOLD TO CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST TO GET TOLD THIS. It took about 18 hours in total after they froze my crypto to get an email saying they were closing my account.I asked for a refund on the \u00a330 fees I paid since they refused to transfer my crypto. Their answer \"Please note that we are unable to waive or give back the standard fees charged in our platform to use our services.\"I didn't use any fees or services because they refused to send my crypto and forced me to sell it so they can profit more money. My money stayed in their bank and they did nothing and want to charge you \u00a330 for the pleasure of closing your account and do nothing. They will do you dirty and still try to scam every cent they can out of you. DO NOT USE THIS EXCHANGE. SCAM SCAM SCAM."

Kraken will not release your money and always has an excuse ready.I invested with Kraken while I was still living in Germany. Since then, I\u2019ve become a digital nomad and am no longer tax resident in Germany. Kraken made a deal with a German tax authority and started requesting documents. I informed Kraken over 15 months ago that I had left Germany, but this information was ignored.Suddenly, my account was locked, even though Kraken had all the information they needed. Their verification does not work with a lot of banks. So I reached out to their so-called customer service, who suggested I could provide a document from my employer. I am my own employer. When I asked what kind of document I should issue for myself, I got no reasonable answer. Then they requested a document from Argentina, where I now live, with my address, a date, a stamp, and my name. Fine. I needed such a document from my university for migration authorities anyway. Yet, someone at Kraken was unable to read the date. Interesting how it\u2019s good enough for immigration but not for Kraken.Then they asked for a document from my landlord. Another weak excuse was found to reject it\u2014the document was in English.In the meantime, 27 emails went back and forth between Kraken and me. Kraken\u2019s responses seemed mostly AI-generated or at least copy-paste. I even tried reaching out to the CEO on LinkedIn, as customer service seems intent on holding onto my funds. No response.On Instagram, I was promised someone with authority would address the issue. Nothing happened."

After 72 hours (which was the time it took my UK bank to clear payment) they closed my account without any explanation and requested i covert coins to USD and withdraw from Kraken platform within 72 hours. The problem is that the only avenue to withdraw funds available on the platform is to use 3rd party wire however, this is only available to US Citizens, of which i am not.I received email from Kraken Support requesting a Bank Statement in order for them to make payment back to my UK account. It has been 48 hours since i provided this information and so far no feedback and my funds remain trapped in an un-usable Kraken account...........i am now getting worried... is this another scam company???Yesterday, i opened up a Dispute with my UK bank and hope this can be escalated.Update 31-Oct.......Payment method was added to the Krakan Page to allow my withdrawal in USD back to my UK bank. The transfer was completed howver, 8 hours later and funds NOT YET arrived to my bank. All bank details were correct and checked multiple times before transaction. If in fact funds do reach my UK bank account i will update further. Ticket # 14054173"

Kraken will not release your money and always has an excuse ready.I invested with Kraken while I was still living in Germany. Since then, I\u2019ve become a digital nomad and am no longer tax resident in Germany. Kraken made a deal with a German tax authority and started requesting documents. I informed Kraken over 15 months ago that I had left Germany, but this information was ignored.Suddenly, my account was locked, even though Kraken had all the information they needed. Their verification does not work with a lot of banks. So I reached out to their so-called customer service, who suggested I could provide a document from my employer. I am my own employer. When I asked what kind of document I should issue for myself, I got no reasonable answer. Then they requested a document from Argentina, where I now live, with my address, a date, a stamp, and my name. Fine. I needed such a document from my university for migration authorities anyway. Yet, someone at Kraken was unable to read the date. Interesting how it\u2019s good enough for immigration but not for Kraken.Then they asked for a document from my landlord. Another weak excuse was found to reject it\u2014the document was in English.In the meantime, 27 emails went back and forth between Kraken and me. Kraken\u2019s responses seemed mostly AI-generated or at least copy-paste. I even tried reaching out to the CEO on LinkedIn, as customer service seems intent on holding onto my funds. No response.On Instagram, I was promised someone with authority would address the issue. Nothing happened."

I am new to Crypto but decided to use this platform as i believed it was regulated and would be safe.I deposited GBP3,800 in USDT in 2 UK Bank Card transactions. After 72 hours (which was the time it took my UK bank to clear payment) they closed my account without any explanation and requested i covert coins to USD and withdraw from Kraken platform within 72 hours. The problem is that the only avenue to withdraw funds available on the platform is to use 3rd party wire however, this is only available to US Citizens, of which i am not.I received email from Kraken Support requesting a Bank Statement in order for them to make payment back to my UK account. It has been 48 hours since i provided this information and so far no feedback and my funds remain trapped in an un-usable Kraken account...........i am now getting worried... is this another scam company???Yesterday, i opened up a Dispute with my UK bank and hope this can be escalated.Update 31-Oct.......Payment method was added to the Krakan Page to allow my withdrawal in USD back to my UK bank. The transfer was completed howver, 8 hours later and funds NOT YET arrived to my bank. All bank details were correct and checked multiple times before transaction. If in fact funds do reach my UK bank account i will update further. Ticket # 14054173"
