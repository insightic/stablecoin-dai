Coinbase, then tell me they cannot trace the money. It is a scam because you have to log a ticket each time. It shows that they don't want to resolve anything but just prolong the issues until the person gets fed up and gives up. What a bloody scam. No support, what so ever. I will take further action."

I recently moved over $40K into my account and Coinbase immediately froze it for security reason.  Original hold was for 7 days.  After verification that all was good, on day 6 Coinbase increased hold to 30 days.  Then 3 days later after another verification process, Coinbase restarted the 30-day clock. Pretty sure in 30 days Coinbase will find another reason to lock out funds for even longer.  Best not to ever use them if you value you funds or expect customer service."

Although they look all hi tech and professional they are scammers and their customer service is a joke. I am in the process of retrieving my money from them- the formal complaint takes 45 business days to process. All this time they will be holding your money hostage. Their customer service is very circular providing no solution- bouncing customers from one chat to another, you CANNOT talk to a real person. Beware and if do use them dont hold a lot of money there- you will not be able to get them out."

In order for us to better assist you, can you please provide information or clarification as to how we can help?\"AND IMMEDIATELY after this message they close the case. And they NEVER reply to my follow up email in which I resend the question according to their request. Probably this is the technique for the customer care staff to spare the work. Strange is different personas send the same canned text, like if it was not one person's technique... They reply and close the ticket, and if they are not checked further technically it looks like a resolved case. This happened now the second time with the same problem."

The worst part was there is absolutely no warning. An hour later I was finally able to chat with customer service who said too bad, the \"blockchain\" decides the fee. I am definitely out of coinbase."

Their employees are incompetent  and ignorant to understand the situation After 3 months they are still asking me to provide my bank account statement to show i have not received the funds, they are so ignorant the do not understand I have used Western UNion and if they have not received the fund back from Coinbase bank there is no money returned to my back account...If they cannot handle traditional banking system imagine how much crypto they steal from people with micro transaction! The company must be closed down, and investigated and audited"

I have sent all the required documents in every iteration of their requests, but they always come back with additional ones that weren't there before. Why not just ask me all the required documents and questions straight away? And now I wait for 30 days between each request until god knows when. It's been almost 5 months and the customer support is slow and unable to give me any straight answers."

A huge problem I have had as a decade long customer is they refuse to provide any customer support by phone. Everything is forcibly done through email by design so they have unlimited time to resolve your case. Sometimes an account is left hanging for months, even over minor issues. They also use overseas reps who are often useless and serve as mere secretaries who\u2019s purpose is to stall or hand out case numbers. I wish the FTC would investigate there practices because no bank or credit card company would get away with this, but for some strange reason these guys get a pass because they are crypto."

Filed a complaint with their complaint department several times( they can review it up to 90 days!),  received an answer that the KYC team is still waiting for me to submit the paperwork!!  I called Support,  sked which paperwork I still need to submit - they responded that all necessary paperwork was submitted already and that the KYC team just needs to review it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Recently begin to receive generic emails from KYC team requesting to confirm my account and providing with the FAQ links to the general info. The last link they send me with the request to provide the info was broken! I replied to the email with explanation and screenshots- no response. Called the customer service- no results . And there is NO Time-limits for them to review your KYC info.Mine has been in \u201ca manual review \u201c for 6 months now\u2026My account with $20,000 is restricted. Not able to withdraw my money, not able to buy coins or anything else\u2026Filed a complaint again\u2026 I got a feeling that they are just regular scammers and the owner will be another Bankman-Fried from FTX and end up in jail.Bad ,bad actors. Do NOT recommend!!!! P.S.Read on Reddit that it was still possible to withdraw your coins while the account was under review . Withdrawing mine for sure!!!"

So they can post the type of generic unhelpful replies as you can see below which have nothing to do with customer service and everything to do with reputation management. My case was closed by them with no recourse in November and the review was months ago.  Too little too late!Update: Coinbase responded in the thread as I predicted saying they will look into it, but their email to me still has restrictions on my account and they won't provide a reason.  I watched their CEO Brian Armstrong recently espouse his vision for Coinbase and it is a far cry from what their customer service and compliance teams are doing to actual customers.  I gave you a chance, so now I'm closing my account...Further update.  Coinbase has now finally restored my account to full operability. It took a while so I have now updated the rating to a 3 star.PS thank God for TrustPilot!"

An example is that you can send USDT over Solana to any exchange, but if you do it to coinbase, it will sit in your account on the blockchain but not show up in your Coinbase account...ever. They refuse to let you get your funds and they're the only ones with access to it. Their customer support is a mix of AI and an army of copy pasta drones. You will never get help. It's like using the blockchain but without any sort of access to your accounts (in other words, worse). It's basically just a very poorly functioning dex, with fake customer support, stuck in the past Ethereum era. Cheating, fossil exchange.I'm sure all the money they collect in their wallets for their customers, then denying them access to their funds, helps with their fake numbers for their stocks.Totally and absolutely gross.I'll be filing with regulators."

I honestly wish I could make this my go-to CEX but everything is.. locked and has been so for over 3 months even after contacting support."

Educational initiatives are being highlighted, which implies an acknowledgment of the need for better user understanding and wider knowledge dissemination to support adoption and informed investment decisions. However, there are no significant new developments, controversies, or milestones being discussed, which could mean that the industry is currently in a state of consolidation or that incremental improvements are being made rather than groundbreaking changes. Lastly, the absence of patterns or strategies related to cryptocurrency manipulation tactics in the reviews suggests that the current discourse is centered on legitimate practices, but it also highlights the importance of ongoing vigilance and the potential need for regulatory frameworks to prevent future malpractices.",

Investors show a clear preference for initiatives that enhance user protection, provide education, and ensure the utility of cryptocurrencies, which are seen as critical for fostering confidence and driving long-term adoption. Partnerships with governments and technological support are highlighted as key areas for further development, indicating a need for ongoing collaboration and innovation to align with regulatory standards and improve security infrastructure. The absence of discussions on market trends or predictions suggests a focus on building a stable and responsible foundation for the cryptocurrency market rather than speculating on its short-term fluctuations. To address these findings, continued efforts in enhancing security measures, ensuring compliance with evolving regulations, and promoting eco-friendly practices are recommended for sustainable growth in the cryptocurrency industry.",

On 2023-12-30, I received a Bitcoin transaction which was initially pending. However, shortly after, my account was flagged for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification by Coinbase. This verification process took an unexpectedly long time, lasting 138 days, before finally completing. Since then, I have been unable to locate the status of my Bitcoin transaction. I am concerned that it may be missing or held in a Coinbase cold wallet due to the KYC verification process. I kindly request your prompt assistance in investigating this matter and providing clarification on the status of my Bitcoin transaction. Any information or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response. CASE ID# 19366248ZAIN AHMAD"

I\u2019m no wizard and sure most of it was luck, but it\u2019s been good to me so far. For anyone having a tentative first crypto experience, I\u2019d highly recommend Coinbase as a good place to start, just don\u2019t get carried away!"

The rewards also don't seem to change none I was getting 3.33 1 week and then the next week getting 13.33 and I got the same amount of rewards and when I message them or try and get support they say they will gladly handle this issue for me and don't say anything about what I asked just that the rewards will be added to the account and they never are. Then thats all they say in support and just leave you hanging. Like today I contacted them and he introduced himself and said I will help you and that's literally all he ever said just left me hanging for like 3 hours. Something is obviously wrong when the rates go up more then triple and you get the same amount of rewards and in more time for example I was supposed to get them every 7 days they just added the rewards and it's been 13 days with a higher rate then the last payout reward and I literally got the same amount of rewards as I did last time for 13 days on a 13.33 rate.

On 2023-12-30, I received a Bitcoin transaction which was initially pending. However, shortly after, my account was flagged for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification by Coinbase. This verification process took an unexpectedly long time, lasting 138 days, before finally completing. Since then, I have been unable to locate the status of my Bitcoin transaction. I am concerned that it may be missing or held in a Coinbase cold wallet due to the KYC verification process. I kindly request your prompt assistance in investigating this matter and providing clarification on the status of my Bitcoin transaction. Any information or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response. CASE ID# 19366248ZAIN AHMAD"

They showed no sympathy at all after weeks of back and forth with all the incompetent agents I dealt with. This company is a thieving fraudulent Joke.

I am writing this to see if we can ensure a quick response with a resolution. I have already tried calling them 4x, chatted with them 3x and several emails back and forth where they just send me in circles and then don\u2019t reply. The issue was with their kyc verification process which was an issue on their end not mine. The reason for this is because when I tried to do the verification process it prompted me for my license but never gave me a prompt for the selfie no matter how many times I tried and I have never had this issue with any other exchange. For an exchange whose part of the U.S stock market you would think they would do a better job since they also charge a yearly price tag for this service which I also pay for. They have locked my account which means they have locked me and my family away from our life\u2019s hard work due to a glitch on their end. There customer service if completely useless as they keep sending you in circles, here we are 2 weeks later and they still can\u2019t get there act l together.They have the basic play book we will get you a solution shortly and email you, than their emails is just a bunch of generic nonsense. Than they started sending me emails with a link to upload some paperwork and of course as usual their links don\u2019t work or just lead to a dead end. I called them that I don\u2019t want to fix this over email as one of these emails is going to end up being a scam and i might accidentally click on one due to all this useless back and forth. They said okay we will have this fixed by tonight and will send you an email as that department doesn\u2019t have a phone line. I mean man can it really get any more shady than that"

There are no other transactions. NONE. This whole platform is a fraud and they will freeze your assets arbitrarily. If that is of no consequence to you, then they might be OK for you. If you may need your BTC - RUN AWAY. I asked for a support case number, BTW and support chat \"mysteriously\" closed on its own. **UPDATE 5/31** I received a notification from TrustPilot that Support from Coinbase.com saw this review, assigned a case number, and urged me to check my email as they are \"ready to assist me further with this concern.\" Of course, you guessed it -- no email was sent to my account....checked inbox, junk, everywhere. Nothing. Went back on chat (Shreya) and directed her to the case number. In fact, they are NOT willing to assist me any further. Can't make this stuff up. It appears even the responses here on TrustPilot.com are fake. Happy to update this if/when something changes, but my advice, again, BEWARE!!!! Find a different crypto trading platform. This is a scam."

They showed no sympathy at all after weeks of back and forth with all the incompetent agents I dealt with. This company is a thieving fraudulent Joke.

In April, they informed me that they were transitioning to a new system and that Coinbase Commerce accounts would be linked to individual Coinbase accounts. I followed all their instructions.I had balances in ETH and BCH in my Coinbase Commerce account. Instead of transferring them to other companies, I decided to transfer them directly to my individual Coinbase account. There was a button to facilitate this transfer for both currencies and I used it for both.However, despite the transactions being marked as complete, the balances never arrived in my wallet. It has now been two months, and despite numerous attempts to resolve this issue, I have received no substantial assistance. Occasionally, I receive vague responses, and it seems even their support team is unaware of the problem's status or solution.In summary, I have lost a total of 850 EUR, and I am extremely frustrated with the lack of communication and resolution from Coinbase Commerce. I strongly advise against using this platform and recommend others to avoid it due to the poor customer service and unresolved issues."

I've switched to Crypto because it would be fast and easy but Coinbase doesn't really seem to realize that yet. Will be taking my funds elsewhere. Again, it would be good if ur just investing, buying and selling but not if you will be sending out Crypto which is one of the things i do alot besides investing."

They showed no sympathy at all after weeks of back and forth with all the incompetent agents I dealt with. This company is a thieving fraudulent Joke.

Instead, it withdrew the money from my savings account, resulting in an overdraft. Now, I owe my bank $30 that I cannot afford, affecting my ability to pay for essential services like garbage collection.In total, $90 has been taken from me. I am very upset and frustrated. According to the membership details, I was supposed to receive text message alerts for crypto price spikes, but I never received any. The membership also mentioned sweepstakes, which I was not informed about. I have not made any transactions or used any membership benefits in the last three months.As a struggling college student, I was completely unaware that Coinbase Global Inc., a company valued at $62.38 billion USD, was withdrawing money from my account.I have tried to contact Coinbase to resolve this issue but haven't found a way to do so.

In April, they informed me that they were transitioning to a new system and that Coinbase Commerce accounts would be linked to individual Coinbase accounts. I followed all their instructions.I had balances in ETH and BCH in my Coinbase Commerce account. Instead of transferring them to other companies, I decided to transfer them directly to my individual Coinbase account. There was a button to facilitate this transfer for both currencies and I used it for both.However, despite the transactions being marked as complete, the balances never arrived in my wallet. It has now been two months, and despite numerous attempts to resolve this issue, I have received no substantial assistance. Occasionally, I receive vague responses, and it seems even their support team is unaware of the problem's status or solution.In summary, I have lost a total of 850 EUR, and I am extremely frustrated with the lack of communication and resolution from Coinbase Commerce. I strongly advise against using this platform and recommend others to avoid it due to the poor customer service and unresolved issues."

I did not knowingly subscribe to this membership and don't recall signing up for it.When Coinbase attempted to withdraw money from my account for the Coinbase 1 membership fee, it failed due to insufficient funds. Instead, it withdrew the money from my savings account, resulting in an overdraft. Now, I owe my bank $30 that I cannot afford, affecting my ability to pay for essential services like garbage collection.In total, $90 has been taken from me. I am very upset and frustrated. According to the membership details, I was supposed to receive text message alerts for crypto price spikes, but I never received any. The membership also mentioned sweepstakes, which I was not informed about. I have not made any transactions or used any membership benefits in the last three months.As a struggling college student, I was completely unaware that Coinbase Global Inc., a company valued at $62.38 billion USD, was withdrawing money from my account.I have tried to contact Coinbase to resolve this issue but haven't found a way to do so. I need assistance from Coinbase to address this situation because I believe I have been wronged, and this is not how customers should be treated."

The chat (when I eventually got hold of an actual person) is utterly pathetic and keeps dropping out and the people on the other end seem to have not the faintest idea what they are doing.  I managed (eventually) to buy some crypto currency but was restricted from buying more and they can't tell me specifically why NOT or when I can buy some more!  So, having completely wasted an hour on their (hopeless) chat help silliness, I decided to cut my losses and get off their useless platform and want to sell my crypto currency and get my money back.  Can I do that?  NO!!!  Their stupid web site keeps asking me to add a *payment* method...  It makes no sense at all!!!Avoid like the plague!  (I'm going to try eToro, next)."

I did not knowingly subscribe to this membership and don't recall signing up for it.When Coinbase attempted to withdraw money from my account for the Coinbase 1 membership fee, it failed due to insufficient funds. Instead, it withdrew the money from my savings account, resulting in an overdraft. Now, I owe my bank $30 that I cannot afford, affecting my ability to pay for essential services like garbage collection.In total, $90 has been taken from me. I am very upset and frustrated. According to the membership details, I was supposed to receive text message alerts for crypto price spikes, but I never received any. The membership also mentioned sweepstakes, which I was not informed about. I have not made any transactions or used any membership benefits in the last three months.As a struggling college student, I was completely unaware that Coinbase Global Inc., a company valued at $62.38 billion USD, was withdrawing money from my account.I have tried to contact Coinbase to resolve this issue but haven't found a way to do so. I need assistance from Coinbase to address this situation because I believe I have been wronged, and this is not how customers should be treated."

The chat (when I eventually got hold of an actual person) is utterly pathetic and keeps dropping out and the people on the other end seem to have not the faintest idea what they are doing.  I managed (eventually) to buy some crypto currency but was restricted from buying more and they can't tell me specifically why NOT or when I can buy some more!  So, having completely wasted an hour on their (hopeless) chat help silliness, I decided to cut my losses and get off their useless platform and want to sell my crypto currency and get my money back.  Can I do that?  NO!!!  Their stupid web site keeps asking me to add a *payment* method...  It makes no sense at all!!!Avoid like the plague!  (I'm going to try eToro, next).Update 10Jun2024:  Trustpilot contacted me re this review stating that Coinbase do not \"recognise your (my) review as genuine\" and Trustpilot want a 'support ticket number'.  Unfortunately (as my review makes clear) I only ever used their utterly useless chat facility and, as far as I am aware, they do not operate a proper 'support ticket' system.  So, asking for one is a bit pointless.  I would also add that given my name is virtually unique on the entire planet, it would take Coinbase about 5 seconds to locate my account and (I assume) the support chat details that resulted in this review.I have since sold my crypto currency holding with Coinbase (at a considerable loss) and am in the process of trying eToro instead.  Certainly the initial sign-up and funding process was a great deal more straight forward.  MW"

I did not knowingly subscribe to this membership and don't recall signing up for it.When Coinbase attempted to withdraw money from my account for the Coinbase 1 membership fee, it failed due to insufficient funds. Instead, it withdrew the money from my savings account, resulting in an overdraft. Now, I owe my bank $30 that I cannot afford, affecting my ability to pay for essential services like garbage collection.In total, $90 has been taken from me. I am very upset and frustrated. According to the membership details, I was supposed to receive text message alerts for crypto price spikes, but I never received any. The membership also mentioned sweepstakes, which I was not informed about. I have not made any transactions or used any membership benefits in the last three months.As a struggling college student, I was completely unaware that Coinbase Global Inc., a company valued at $62.38 billion USD, was withdrawing money from my account.I have tried to contact Coinbase to resolve this issue but haven't found a way to do so. I need assistance from Coinbase to address this situation because I believe I have been wronged, and this is not how customers should be treated."

It said i could not trade it to cash. Weird. Okay. Try on phone. Same error. Contact support. They have no clue either. But they say that my ticket is a \"Priority.\" LmfaoA few days later to 1 week goes by. No updates. I reach out again and again. No updates. Then my account suddenly is restricted. I KYC again. On page it says I am approved and everything is fine. I even did the KYC with the same ID i used last time. Account is still restricted. So i waited 24 hours. Nothing changes. Reach out to support. \"Your account is a priority for us.\" Complete and total lies. So i did the KYC input again 2-3 days later after another support rep said they didn't receive anything. Okay sure. At this point its been 1.5 weeks. Wait. Nothing happens. Contact support. Rep says to email the KYC people by replying to the email they sent me. I have replied twice. NO RESPONSE. I contact support 1.5 weeks later cuz i have better things to do for $200. \"Your account is a priority.\" Its just getting idiotic at this point. My goal in writing this review is to make someone higher up look at my account because this is insane for $200. Ive wasted like 8 hours of my life on this. Absolutely insane. All trust lost. Dont trust these people with your money. Look at the reviews on here. Its this way for a reason. UPDATE:SEE WHAT I MEAN...LOOK AT THIS INSANE RESPONSE BELOW. I have been a customer for 5+ years and I have to wait 3 weeks to be KYC'd again when ive already KYC'd twice...HAHAHAHAHA. This is PATHETIC."

The process to trasnfer money to enable trading didnt work initially despite various attempts, but finally got a'fast bank transfer' completed which was over clunky in itsel, but this can take up to 2 days to actually hit my account....it's a FAST bank transfer, it should be immediate! I'm STILL WAITING to make my first trade after opening my account 3 days ago, by which time the crypto Im targeting has gone up price, so missed the initial opportunity to buy effectively.I have two other industry leading trading accounts and they work significantly more efficiently than Coinbase.Seems I've been duped - as soon as my cash clears I'm withdrawing it & closing the account.

They could not give me a reason, but I would bet it was because I used a hard wallet and not their hot wallet. They couldn't hold my money after my purchases were completed. I could purchase within their platform, burt I couldn't move it out from their possesion. Crazy thing, they would allow me to withdraw it for deposit to my back.

They could not give me a reason, but I would bet it was because I used a hard wallet and not their hot wallet. They couldn't hold my money after my purchases were completed. I could purchase within their platform, burt I couldn't move it out from their possesion. Crazy thing, they would allow me to withdraw it for deposit to my back. It was being held as USDC, so it was available for deposit immediately. Do not waste your time and money."

The lack of clear error messages or guidance on how to resolve this issue only adds to the frustration.Customer support hasn't been much help either.

They could not give me a reason, but I would bet it was because I used a hard wallet and not their hot wallet. They couldn't hold my money after my purchases were completed. I could purchase within their platform, burt I couldn't move it out from their possesion. Crazy thing, they would allow me to withdraw it for deposit to my back. It was being held as USDC, so it was available for deposit immediately. Do not waste your time and money."

My trades are fairly large so that makes a big difference. I am able to cover those charges in the trades so have never paid attention but I have just noticed that I should have been charged \u00a374 for a trade I set up but was charged \u00a3248.

They could not give me a reason, but I would bet it was because I used a hard wallet and not their hot wallet. They couldn't hold my money after my purchases were completed. I could purchase within their platform, burt I couldn't move it out from their possesion. Crazy thing, they would allow me to withdraw it for deposit to my back.

Recently had funds stolen from my account and THOUGHT the issue was completely resolved, but now they're saying i OWE THEM over $600! Why do i have to pay them when my own money was stolen from my account? Absolutely not. Will add more details. Over the weekend at the beginning of this month, my coinbase account was accessed without my knowledge and resulted in over $600 being stolen. They transferred money from my bank account and used that money to purchase bitcoin and deposit them into multiple wallets. Now once i saw this, i immediately contacted my bank but since this took place over the weekend, i had to wait for the transactions to post. I waited till Monday and contacted my bank, from there the dispute was open and i received my funds back shortly after. I contacted coinbase and told them everything that happened with sufficient evidence and responses from my bank and that was it. I reset my account's security and thats was that. Or so i thought. I see they now want me to pay back over $600, claiming that they never received MY OWN MONEY when the money from my account was confirmed to be posted and sent to coinbase. Even when i had substantial proof that the funds were 100% stolen, they still expect me to pay them. This is why im never coming back to this company.Ive talked to numerous support agents and they have all given me the exact same responses one after the other. Never coming back. This absolutely should not happen."

Over the past few weeks, I've spoken to numerous representatives (probably between 50 to 100), and the process has been incredibly frustrating. One particular representative informed me that she would place a lock on my account because she \"felt\" it could be fraudulent, despite providing all necessary documentation to prove my identity.I have repeatedly requested that they unlock my account so I can withdraw my funds, but they keep delaying the process. Initially, they told me my account would be unlocked by the 24th of this month, but after further arguments and back-and-forth communication, they extended the date to July 16th. This feels like a deliberate attempt to withhold my funds.I understand the need for security, but this has gone beyond reasonable measures. I am deeply disappointed and feel scammed by Coinbase. They need to improve their customer service and handle cases like mine with more professionalism and urgency.I've filed a complaint with the appropriate consumer protection agencies due to their mishandling of my account. I also want to warn others that after reading this review, Coinbase might reply pretending to offer help, but in my experience, this is just a facade to appear helpful while continuing their unprofessional practices."

Recently had funds stolen from my account and THOUGHT the issue was completely resolved, but now they're saying i OWE THEM over $600! Why do i have to pay them when my own money was stolen from my account? Absolutely not. Will add more details. Over the weekend at the beginning of this month, my coinbase account was accessed without my knowledge and resulted in over $600 being stolen. They transferred money from my bank account and used that money to purchase bitcoin and deposit them into multiple wallets. Now once i saw this, i immediately contacted my bank but since this took place over the weekend, i had to wait for the transactions to post. I waited till Monday and contacted my bank, from there the dispute was open and i received my funds back shortly after. I contacted coinbase and told them everything that happened with sufficient evidence and responses from my bank and that was it. I reset my account's security and thats was that. Or so i thought. I see they now want me to pay back over $600, claiming that they never received MY OWN MONEY when the money from my account was confirmed to be posted and sent to coinbase. Even when i had substantial proof that the funds were 100% stolen, they still expect me to pay them. This is why im never coming back to this company.Ive talked to numerous support agents and they have all given me the exact same responses one after the other. Never coming back. This absolutely should not happen."

One particular representative informed me that she would place a lock on my account because she \"felt\" it could be fraudulent, despite providing all necessary documentation to prove my identity.I have repeatedly requested that they unlock my account so I can withdraw my funds, but they keep delaying the process. Initially, they told me my account would be unlocked by the 24th of this month, but after further arguments and back-and-forth communication, they extended the date to July 16th. This feels like a deliberate attempt to withhold my funds.I understand the need for security, but this has gone beyond reasonable measures. I am deeply disappointed and feel scammed by Coinbase. They need to improve their customer service and handle cases like mine with more professionalism and urgency.I've filed a complaint with the appropriate consumer protection agencies due to their mishandling of my account. I also want to warn others that after reading this review, Coinbase might reply pretending to offer help, but in my experience, this is just a facade to appear helpful while continuing their unprofessional practices."

Ok, so I can understand maybe once but I was sending the BTC to the same address as the first time. Their complaint system is convoluted. You need a case number, which neither the telephone not the chat extends to you. They no longer have support tickets. Essentially, it's virtually impossible to get anything done because Coinbase ensures that the process of contacting them and having a decision made in your best interest will not happen. Their system conveys the idea that they would rather not be bothered. That's where the window dressing comes in. I had to literally beg for a support case number. After paying an exorbitant transaction fee, they delay my transaction. They suck!In response to CB's 06/25/24 reply:Your email is just more CB boilerplate BS! You have no problem with me buying and paying your hefty transaction fees but to transfer out to my own wallet a week after being flagged on a transaction to the same wallet is pure BS. I updated my ID last week. CB has gotten bigger than it can handle and consequently is tripping over itself. Get your act together; your service in the name of security is pathetic.

Crypto is risky enough and then your wallet shafts you.I would certainly look elsewhere for your crypto investments. In their review they don't even look at the issue, rather they just send a pre scripted reply out of hidden terms manual.I have sold this same coin with them a couple times and this has never been a issue.When sold the coin was at $1.54 and they only paid $1.00 per coin, at 1,143 coins that amounts to $640 they took out of my sale. The kicker is the coin has only gone up since then so they didn't even need their spread."

I'm just glad it was only $150. Very untrustworthy site which you should stay away from. Now been speaking to many people for over 6 hours since 23rd May. I so bored of this rubbish. Will try again later, I just don't want them to nick my money after the amount of fees I have paid in the last year. Getting fobbed off then someone else would start the chat again.

The lack of clear error messages or guidance on how to resolve this issue only adds to the frustration.Customer support hasn't been much help either. Despite reaching out multiple times, I have yet to receive a response that addresses the problem. The app's reliability is crucial for managing my assets, and these login issues are unacceptable.I hope Coinbase addresses this problem quickly, as it severely impacts the user experience.

He had me change browsers, download the app, and reupload my face verification. Which he looked at and was very unprofessional when he said \"you are very pretty.\" I sat in stunned silence as it was very unprofessional and I didn't want to acknowledge it. When he repeated himself (as if he wanted to make sure I heard him the first time) I told him that saying that was weird. He didn't apologize. He wasn't able to fix the issue, or even tell me that I had to do the e-transfer. He kept finding new things he thought were wrong. I got sick of waiting and ended up just doing the e-transfer to the coinbase account before being able to withdraw the money. They then took the money I had e-transferred to coinbase and called it the \"fee.\" Horrible customers service.

They make it seem like they are doing something but have no authority to act. My BTC withdrawal to my personal wallet was delayed for 72 hours, two weeks in a row. Ok, so I can understand maybe once but I was sending the BTC to the same address as the first time. Their complaint system is convoluted. You need a case number, which neither the telephone not the chat extends to you. They no longer have support tickets. Essentially, it's virtually impossible to get anything done because Coinbase ensures that the process of contacting them and having a decision made in your best interest will not happen. Their system conveys the idea that they would rather not be bothered. That's where the window dressing comes in. I had to literally beg for a support case number. After paying an exorbitant transaction fee, they delay my transaction. They suck!In response to CB's 06/25/24 reply:Your email is just more CB boilerplate BS! You have no problem with me buying and paying your hefty transaction fees but to transfer out to my own wallet a week after being flagged on a transaction to the same wallet is pure BS. I updated my ID last week. CB has gotten bigger than it can handle and consequently is tripping over itself. Get your act together; your service in the name of security is pathetic. If you have concerns about my identity send me a SMS and stop the BS!"

After 3 hours of conversations they said it would be sent back into my original account 30 days later. Now it's 32 days later and no sign of it. Now back on to them, they are fobbing me off. I'm just glad it was only $150. Very untrustworthy site which you should stay away from. Now been speaking to many people for over 6 hours since 23rd May. I so bored of this rubbish. Will try again later, I just don't want them to nick my money after the amount of fees I have paid in the last year. Getting fobbed off then someone else would start the chat again.

Crypto is risky enough and then your wallet shafts you.I would certainly look elsewhere for your crypto investments. In their review they don't even look at the issue, rather they just send a pre scripted reply out of hidden terms manual.I have sold this same coin with them a couple times and this has never been a issue.When sold the coin was at $1.54 and they only paid $1.00 per coin, at 1,143 coins that amounts to $640 they took out of my sale. The kicker is the coin has only gone up since then so they didn't even need their spread."

He wasn't able to fix the issue, or even tell me that I had to do the e-transfer. He kept finding new things he thought were wrong. I got sick of waiting and ended up just doing the e-transfer to the coinbase account before being able to withdraw the money. They then took the money I had e-transferred to coinbase and called it the \"fee.\" Horrible customers service. I was on the phone for 50 minutes before he even figured out the error message I was getting was the issue, and still wasn't able to give me an answer by 1 hour 20 minutes into the call."

                "review": "Coinbase sucks! Why? Because their customer service is window dressing; they don't actually do anything. They make it seem like they are doing something but have no authority to act. My BTC withdrawal to my personal wallet was delayed for 72 hours, two weeks in a row. Ok, so I can understand maybe once but I was sending the BTC to the same address as the first time. Their complaint system is convoluted. You need a case number, which neither the telephone not the chat extends to you. They no longer have support tickets. Essentially, it's virtually impossible to get anything done because Coinbase ensures that the process of contacting them and having a decision made in your best interest will not happen. Their system conveys the idea that they would rather not be bothered. That's where the window dressing comes in. I had to literally beg for a support case number. After paying an exorbitant transaction fee, they delay my transaction. They suck!In response to CB's 06/25/24 reply:Your email is just more CB boilerplate BS! You have no problem with me buying and paying your hefty transaction fees but to transfer out to my own wallet a week after being flagged on a transaction to the same wallet is pure BS. I updated my ID last week. CB has gotten bigger than it can handle and consequently is tripping over itself. Get your act together; your service in the name of security is pathetic. If you have concerns about my identity send me a SMS and stop the BS!"

They stated for security reasons, but it is for something far more sinister. Simply put, they want your Biometric Data.Coinbase has implemented a policy where you do nothing wrong, they lock you out of your account and funds. They require a customer to take live photos, front and back of your ID. Then, enable the voice and video on your phone. Ask you to video yourself, turn your head either right or left and call out three numbers.Coinbase holds ALL your funds hostage until you comply. Your trading ability is suspended until they get what they want. Your Bio Data! Coinbase is up to something and it\u2019s not about your security.I spent 6 hours today making 3rd grade TicTok videos of myself. They now have more face photos, ID, and Passport than my own family. This is obviously not about security whatsoever.  After clearing my ID to get my money, they held sending crypto for 24HRS and then delayed my transactions for another 72HRS.After reading the other recent 1-star reviews, this appears to be larger problem possibly illegal and fraudulent. Coinbase has become a communist company filled with fools."

It was no small task to get an account setup on Coinbase.  I had to do a lot of work to make that happen.  I am good with security, but I sent a wire from my bank account $2 grand of which Coinbase charged me $10.  I purchased the crypto on Coinbase, but when I tried to send the crypto to simpleswap, they stopped the transaction for a review and have now said they will keep my ability to send the crypto until September 8 (60 days).  I totally regret using this service.  Please check out other exchanges before you allow these people to hold your money hostage.

I purchased the crypto on Coinbase, but when I tried to send the crypto to simpleswap, they stopped the transaction for a review and have now said they will keep my ability to send the crypto until September 8 (60 days).  I totally regret using this service.  Please check out other exchanges before you allow these people to hold your money hostage.

I have already started the migration process to another platform. It's just crap just like cryptomus since they changed their risk merchant acceptance.There are better alternatives...

Because my code worked. Because I could earn about \u00a360-\u00a390 a day with just \u00a33000 in my Coinbase account. Because I was making a profit instead of losing money.Even though my total trading volume over those 2 days was \u00a34 million, it doesn't matter.

Because my code worked. Because I could earn about \u00a360-\u00a390 a day with just \u00a33000 in my Coinbase account. Because I was making a profit instead of losing money.Even though my total trading volume over those 2 days was \u00a34 million, it doesn't matter. If I can make \u00a30.001 with a quick sell and buy, I will do it every second, 86,400 times a day, to make \u00a386.40.But they don't want you to make money."

As a result of this, I have missed out on some great trading opportunities that would have made me thousands but I couldn\u2019t take them because my funds are stuck on Coinbase. I am writing to you\u00a0to give you the opportunity to give me a settlement to make up for the thousands of pounds I could have made through trading had I been able to withdraw my funds to Bitget, as well as the large amount of stress this situation has had on me. If you are not willing to do this I will have to report this issue to a small claims court. Please let me know as soon as possible as to your decision. Kind regards, Buddy"

And of course their idiotic system doesn't have support or a solution for cases like mine because God forbid that would mean they would have to actually work to solve the issue instead of letting the whole system being run by a dumb AI."

As a result of this, I have missed out on some great trading opportunities that would have made me thousands but I couldn\u2019t take them because my funds are stuck on Coinbase. I am writing to you\u00a0to give you the opportunity to give me a settlement to make up for the thousands of pounds I could have made through trading had I been able to withdraw my funds to Bitget, as well as the large amount of stress this situation has had on me. If you are not willing to do this I will have to report this issue to a small claims court. Please let me know as soon as possible as to your decision. Kind regards, Buddy"

                "review": "Hi there, Coinbase is not allowing me to withdraw crypto to another exchange. I understand that every company has technical issues every now and then, but I made Coinbase aware of this problem months ago, and it still hasn\u2019t been resolved. I was also taking to customer support for hours today, and they still can\u2019t solve the problem. As a result of this, I have missed out on some great trading opportunities that would have made me thousands but I couldn\u2019t take them because my funds are stuck on Coinbase. I am writing to you\u00a0to give you the opportunity to give me a settlement to make up for the thousands of pounds I could have made through trading had I been able to withdraw my funds to Bitget, as well as the large amount of stress this situation has had on me. If you are not willing to do this I will have to report this issue to a small claims court. Please let me know as soon as possible as to your decision. Kind regards, Buddy"

The refund issuer has confirmed to me that the refund was successfully processed. I do not understand why such a large and reputable company has a problem with a refund for days. I urgently need the money for my livelihood.No, you don't understand. I urgently need the money. I know some refunds take time, but I am 28 years old and have never experienced this before. I have always received refunds within a day, no matter the company. I can't buy food with your apology. I am a Coinbase One customer and don't understand why you can't issue me the refund immediately.But it doesn\u2019t help, no matter what I say or how I try to explain the situation. You keep responding with standard and same messages. I am very frustrated. Have a nice day...// after 15 days I received my money a few hours ago."

I was also taking to customer support for hours today, and they still can\u2019t solve the problem. As a result of this, I have missed out on some great trading opportunities that would have made me thousands but I couldn\u2019t take them because my funds are stuck on Coinbase. I am writing to you\u00a0to give you the opportunity to give me a settlement to make up for the thousands of pounds I could have made through trading had I been able to withdraw my funds to Bitget, as well as the large amount of stress this situation has had on me. If you are not willing to do this I will have to report this issue to a small claims court. Please let me know as soon as possible as to your decision. Kind regards, Buddy"

I understand that every company has technical issues every now and then, but I made Coinbase aware of this problem months ago, and it still hasn\u2019t been resolved. I was also taking to customer support for hours today, and they still can\u2019t solve the problem. As a result of this, I have missed out on some great trading opportunities that would have made me thousands but I couldn\u2019t take them because my funds are stuck on Coinbase. I am writing to you\u00a0to give you the opportunity to give me a settlement to make up for the thousands of pounds I could have made through trading had I been able to withdraw my funds to Bitget, as well as the large amount of stress this situation has had on me. If you are not willing to do this I will have to report this issue to a small claims court. Please let me know as soon as possible as to your decision. Kind regards, Buddy"

My question is why coinbase wallets Doesn't verified before receiving any fake coins into the wallets, o created coinbase wallets. And send the Ethirium address to the senders. But senders sent me fake Ethirium meta coins in the wallets, which i can't withdraw, can't transfer, even can't swap, i do believed coinbase company are involved with this kind of scammed activities, If they do verified before they receiving any coins so obviously sender can't sent any kind of fake coins, I am really loosing my big amounts cause of coinbase wallets. I have another wallets in Kucoin, they always protect any kind of fake coins, they never received such fake coins, But coinbase wallets are involved with the Scammer,"

                "review": "There was a problem with my initial cash deposit due to my bank distrusting them, 875 days ago according to the Coinbase website. At the time they agreed to sell the crypto to recover the cost. The amount in question was $267.91. I went to use the account again today 3/8/24 for an unrelated transaction but there was a problem from their end. I was unaware they didn't sell the Bitcoin that they said they would. They bounced back 2 payments from me of $280 when I tried to bring the account back into credit. I spent almost 3 hours yesterday on their chat trying to deposit the money and another 4+hours today trying to get them to fix their stuff up. Got disconnected from the chat on 5 separate occasions, had a couple saying their were resolving it with the Escalations only to be disconnected. A day and a half later still nothing has happened and no-one has come back to me."

BTW, customer service, when they pick up, steers me to a sight, that has veered me to 0 resolutions. It's been 1 thing after another. Thankfully, I have gotten to the process of face recognition, but it does not work, even trying on several different devices.

But senders sent me fake Ethirium meta coins in the wallets, which i can't withdraw, can't transfer, even can't swap, i do believed coinbase company are involved with this kind of scammed activities, If they do verified before they receiving any coins so obviously sender can't sent any kind of fake coins, I am really loosing my big amounts cause of coinbase wallets.

Although Coinbase did make me jump through quite a few hoops to move my own money, the final hangup where I thought they were just holding my funds hostage was due to my VPN. If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out. They REALLY did everything in their power to assist and that goes a long way with me."

The reason? I live in the UK but am a citizen of another country, and they demand that I have a UK passport to proceed. Despite having valid identification from my home country, they refused to accept it and had the audacity to suggest that I should \"get a UK ID.\"This is blatant discrimination and should be pursued legally. I have never experienced such terrible treatment from any company before.

                "review": "I received a call from coinbase saying there had been an attempt to hack my account, a representative of coinbase will contact you shortly. Shortly after I received a call from supposed representative saying someone has changed my password and my email address and was located in Utah. Well I\u2019m far away in Pennsylvania so this wasn\u2019t possible but surely raised my concerns. He went on about what needs to be done which all sounded logical to me, transfer all of my funds from coinbase to my hard wallet. Then lock my coinbase account. Ok so I agreed obviously. So he walked me thru the process mainly because I\u2019m not an expert in crypto, he had access to my coinbase account because he actually gave me my balance. So I trusted him. I copied and pasted the hashtag to send it to my wallet. Long story short it never happened and when I contacted coinbase they said they can\u2019t do anything about it but here is the address it went to which did not match the one I gave. I filed a complaint with IC3 but haven\u2019t received any response yet. I don\u2019t know where to turn to now. I trusted Coinbase but now they let me down in a very bad way."

Despite having provided my (correct) ID, address etc countless times I am yet to get through the verification process.While support staff is friendly, they have been completely unable to offer any support what so ever, apart from \"checking their boxes\" with getting me to upload my ID again again again. Sometimes, telling me they are in contact with the \"Specialist team\" which surpricingly, also can only tell me to upload my ID again. Like seriously, come up with another solution, you've tried this 14 times it obviously does not work. Next step will have to be an official complaint, and then legal action, as I have exhausted all options, and no one at Coinbase seems to care or are able to offer any working solutions to something that litterally anywhere else is a trivial issue, quickly solved by customer support."

(I had already linked my bank account.) Second, when I finally attempted it, the transfer was flagged as suspicious and my ability to even attempt a transfer was blocked, and it remains blocked to this day. There was nothing suspicious about my attempt to transfer the bitcoin. I had tried to send it to my wallet at Exodus, a very reputable entity. For some incomprehensible reason, this was deemed suspicious by Coinbase! Despite having spoken to two different Coinbase representatives, the freeze remains in place.

If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out.

Their customer service is an absolute joke, and I genuinely feel like I should sue them for their discriminatory practices.After being a loyal customer for three years, they suddenly decided to freeze my account, claiming they couldn't verify my identity because my address didn't match their records. The reason? I live in the UK but am a citizen of another country, and they demand that I have a UK passport to proceed. Despite having valid identification from my home country, they refused to accept it and had the audacity to suggest that I should \"get a UK ID.\"This is blatant discrimination and should be pursued legally. I have never experienced such terrible treatment from any company before. If I had more time, I would take this to court, but for now, I'm left with a frozen account and wasted money.This company is an absolute disgrace, and I strongly advise everyone to steer clear. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to go through the nightmare I did. Never again!"

Shortly after I received a call from supposed representative saying someone has changed my password and my email address and was located in Utah. Well I\u2019m far away in Pennsylvania so this wasn\u2019t possible but surely raised my concerns. He went on about what needs to be done which all sounded logical to me, transfer all of my funds from coinbase to my hard wallet. Then lock my coinbase account. Ok so I agreed obviously. So he walked me thru the process mainly because I\u2019m not an expert in crypto, he had access to my coinbase account because he actually gave me my balance. So I trusted him. I copied and pasted the hashtag to send it to my wallet. Long story short it never happened and when I contacted coinbase they said they can\u2019t do anything about it but here is the address it went to which did not match the one I gave. I filed a complaint with IC3 but haven\u2019t received any response yet. I don\u2019t know where to turn to now. I trusted Coinbase but now they let me down in a very bad way."

I go through the steps and now they can't verify my ID. This is the same ID I used to create the account and it was verified then. I finally talk to someone through chat after 3 days of trying to get my ID verified. During this time I lost money because the bitcoin I was trying to transfer or at this time sell and withdraw the usd value dropped in price. They then send me another email saying if I verify my ID the transfer will go through same day but if I choose not to verify the transaction will go through in 72hrs anyway. Who knows jow much money I will be down by then. Their fees are already high. The representative (Amid) told me he was showing that my ID was verified but yet I still can't transfer. Once  I receive my money I am closing this account and recommend no one opens an account here. They also stop helping me in the chat and the chat was disabled. I just don't understand how I can be verified enough to deposit money in and be charged a fee but I can't transfer, even after reverifying. I lost money in fees and with bitcoin going down and not being able to sell/withdraw the money."

If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out.

Second, when I finally attempted it, the transfer was flagged as suspicious and my ability to even attempt a transfer was blocked, and it remains blocked to this day. There was nothing suspicious about my attempt to transfer the bitcoin. I had tried to send it to my wallet at Exodus, a very reputable entity. For some incomprehensible reason, this was deemed suspicious by Coinbase! Despite having spoken to two different Coinbase representatives, the freeze remains in place.

Their customer service is an absolute joke, and I genuinely feel like I should sue them for their discriminatory practices.After being a loyal customer for three years, they suddenly decided to freeze my account, claiming they couldn't verify my identity because my address didn't match their records. The reason? I live in the UK but am a citizen of another country, and they demand that I have a UK passport to proceed. Despite having valid identification from my home country, they refused to accept it and had the audacity to suggest that I should \"get a UK ID.\"This is blatant discrimination and should be pursued legally. I have never experienced such terrible treatment from any company before. If I had more time, I would take this to court, but for now, I'm left with a frozen account and wasted money.This company is an absolute disgrace, and I strongly advise everyone to steer clear. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to go through the nightmare I did. Never again!"

Although Coinbase did make me jump through quite a few hoops to move my own money, the final hangup where I thought they were just holding my funds hostage was due to my VPN. If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out. They REALLY did everything in their power to assist and that goes a long way with me."

But delays due to Coinbase's ineptitude prevented me from carrying this out. First, I had to wait more than eight days before I could attempt to send my bitcoin from Coinbase to my wallet. (I had already linked my bank account.) Second, when I finally attempted it, the transfer was flagged as suspicious and my ability to even attempt a transfer was blocked, and it remains blocked to this day. There was nothing suspicious about my attempt to transfer the bitcoin. I had tried to send it to my wallet at Exodus, a very reputable entity. For some incomprehensible reason, this was deemed suspicious by Coinbase! Despite having spoken to two different Coinbase representatives, the freeze remains in place. The thing that truly surprises me is that Coinbase is recommended by Investopedia, among others!"

I have another wallets in Kucoin, they always protect any kind of fake coins, they never received such fake coins, But coinbase wallets are involved with the Scammer,"

My guess is that they invest funds for a week for all new accounts to profit from it themselves.Also be warned, their support team is TERRIBLE!!! i literally cannot believe they say some of the things they say - they are USELESS.

Although Coinbase did make me jump through quite a few hoops to move my own money, the final hangup where I thought they were just holding my funds hostage was due to my VPN. If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out. They REALLY did everything in their power to assist and that goes a long way with me."

So in essence, they 100% steal your money. They are disgusting scum. Don't use them. Spare yourself the nightmare of this thieving decrepit company. They are soon to go under with these pitiful and well deserved reviews."

Although Coinbase did make me jump through quite a few hoops to move my own money, the final hangup where I thought they were just holding my funds hostage was due to my VPN. If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out. They REALLY did everything in their power to assist and that goes a long way with me."

They are soon to go under with these pitiful and well deserved reviews."

My guess is that they invest funds for a week for all new accounts to profit from it themselves.Also be warned, their support team is TERRIBLE!!! i literally cannot believe they say some of the things they say - they are USELESS.

Although Coinbase did make me jump through quite a few hoops to move my own money, the final hangup where I thought they were just holding my funds hostage was due to my VPN. If you have any issues with transfers being considered \"suspicious\", disable your VPN. Coinbase's support was hella nice and dealt with my angry a** for like three hours. I'm still not a *huge* fan of Coinbase but their support team really did help me and made me feel like at the very least, they cared about my troubles. Aside from that, Coinbase has a ton of features and a generally simple yet attractive framework. The only complaint that I have left is that their fees are a bit high, but if you're like me and trade a lot/high values, it would be worth it to get the monthly subscription. I really want to reiterate, if I continued to have trouble withdrawing my money any longer than I did today, I would have never used Coinbase again. I want to personally thank Jannah and Yash (I think was his name.. I can't quite remember) from the Support team for helping me out. They REALLY did everything in their power to assist and that goes a long way with me."

So, during that month I sold it all (at a profit) and returned over 5K back to my bank account. It is one thing to block a transaction, and totally another to restrict an account for a month. Since then, the  business that Coinbase considered to be risky, returned my funds also, with a profit. These exchanges think they can do whatever they want, with no consequence. I will just take my business elsewhere."

                "review": "Currently, it appears that Coinbase, under its verification policies, has essentially seized my entire account balance. When attempting to deposit funds into a non-verified account, Coinbase has no issues whatsoever. However, as soon as you attempt to verify your account with valid documents, Coinbase tells you that you\u2019re wrong. Apparently, your documents must include an address. Seriously? So, Coinbase allows deposits but then denies verification because Israeli documents don\u2019t meet their standards? This is outright fraud. Why is it not possible to withdraw funds from your exchange in such cases? Support refuses to assist, citing these absurd rules. Who in their right mind asks for an address on a passport? There are separate documents specifically for address verification. This definitely seems like an attempt at fraud by Coinbase.What can be done?1.  If Coinbase provides services to Israeli citizens (as stated on their website), then they should offer all possible options for document verification, not just those that are non-functional in our case.  2.  If this is all false, then allow the withdrawal of already transferred funds; otherwise, this is outright theft and fraud.I would like Coinbase support to pay more attention to the issue, as it currently looks like a massive scam by a major company. I'll be glad to update the review, in case they finally would help me out."

I tried to change some account info (email address and legal name), and their documented process put me into an endless loop of uploading my ID. I tried to chat with support, which appears to be handled out of India, but we weren't understanding one another, and I asked to talk to someone else. He refused. Not very helpful at all, situation not resolved.Update: Not as bad as I was had thought, but still some confusion from reading the documentation. Help documentation for updating the legal name, as well as the user interface for doing so, both fail to indicate that once the ID is submitted the change will be done by Coinbase and may take a day or more to complete.  I had assumed (scary, I know!) that I needed to make the change and would be allowed to do so since that is what happens with the email field. When I couldn't make the change to the legal name field I thought an error had occurred, when in truth none had.Still, despite my own mistake, talking to support was not helpful as they did not question me at all about what procedure I had followed, and the fellow I talked to wasn't really listening to me other than to try to tell me to follow the help documentation (which I was sure I had done)."

I rarely used Coinbase in the first place but now account has been restricted for around 6 months now.. they have to reason other than telling me the same nonsense they told me 6 months ago I wish they had an option to upload screenshots so you can see how absurd their responses are. Honestly guys just create your own wallets that aren't controlled by an exchange. Buy only little amounts on exchanges and immediately send it to a wallet where you hold your private keys.. Coinbase is way to risky to invest money in this platform.. all the reviews say the same thing. Listen to the reviews because they are all telling tht truth, that's why Coinbase is only responding to the fake bot comments on playstore that are praising them, and ignoring the critical important comments on Trustpilot. It won't be straight away but I guarantee they will eventually screw you over lol. JUST DONT DO IT (:"

I rarely used Coinbase in the first place but now account has been restricted for around 6 months now.. they have to reason other than telling me the same nonsense they told me 6 months ago I wish they had an option to upload screenshots so you can see how absurd their responses are. Honestly guys just create your own wallets that aren't controlled by an exchange. Buy only little amounts on exchanges and immediately send it to a wallet where you hold your private keys.. Coinbase is way to risky to invest money in this platform.. all the reviews say the same thing. Listen to the reviews because they are all telling tht truth, that's why Coinbase is only responding to the fake bot comments on playstore that are praising them, and ignoring the critical important comments on Trustpilot. It won't be straight away but I guarantee they will eventually screw you over lol. JUST DONT DO IT (:"

So, during that month I sold it all (at a profit) and returned over 5K back to my bank account. It is one thing to block a transaction, and totally another to restrict an account for a month. Since then, the  business that Coinbase considered to be risky, returned my funds also, with a profit. These exchanges think they can do whatever they want, with no consequence.

So as I had never used before I transfered a few small amounts to another wallet to make sure I was doing it correctly as I was scared of losing my investment.My three small transferees worked and I thought great now to move the rest and as I tried my account got locked as they said due to suspicious activity.Contact customer support you just tell you it's been escalated but nothing they can do.Can't offer a phone contact or even an email to contact the team dealing with review.Thanks coin base I might just lose my business now due to your lack of urgency.Never never will I ever."

I spent hours with support to try to rectify this.The account is still locked, and I have initiated a recovery process.  Waiting for id review to come back.  Support could not give me a definitive answer as to why the transaction failed or why I was locked out of the account.It is my opinion that this is being done only because I wanted to send all of the funds to a wallet. Coinbase support have not been able to give me a reason for it.  I am concerned that coinbase may be another FTX and is actually insolvent.It has been my intent to move my funds to a wallet from the start.  Now I am even more concerned about using coinbase for anything.I am also contacting the SEC and FBI.  Coinbase is now regulated by the SEC as a broker/dealer and must adhere to their rules for custodial funds.  I will ask the FBI if there are any current investigations of coinbase.

So as I had never used before I transfered a few small amounts to another wallet to make sure I was doing it correctly as I was scared of losing my investment.My three small transferees worked and I thought great now to move the rest and as I tried my account got locked as they said due to suspicious activity.Contact customer support you just tell you it's been escalated but nothing they can do.Can't offer a phone contact or even an email to contact the team dealing with review.Thanks coin base I might just lose my business now due to your lack of urgency.Never never will I ever. 2/9/24So read the answer and supplied the information they required so that the could expediate the solution.Yup the still full of unhelpfulness and thay have not been it touch again."

I then decided to provide with a bank statement and my account got approved. That was for a day, as after rhat my account was restricted under a manual review. I visited the support via live chat and a representative informed me that the Compliance will send me an email. A day after i received an email from the compliance asking for several documents such as source of funds, payslips, confirmation from HR that i am employed etc etc. I found it quite strange, as i did not even deposit to my coinbase, however i did provide with all required KYC documents and answered to all of their questions. After uploaded my last payslip, the Compliance asked me that they needed a bank statememt with my salary credit date. I did that as well and still my account is not vetified, as the Compliance team kept asking me for further documents. I replied that i had enough and i am not interested. Waste of time and the worst experience i had. I do have other wallets with Regulated wallets and never had such an issue. Stay away"

I got bounced around from agent to agent due to chat \u201cinactivity\u201d, but only on their part\u2014they take forever to respond! My last interaction with an agent today was the final nail in the coffin. He told me it didn\u2019t make it \u201cdue to many reasons\u201d, including technical issues, and told me to try again in 24 hours.

I spent hours with support to try to rectify this.The account is still locked, and I have initiated a recovery process.  Waiting for id review to come back.  Support could not give me a definitive answer as to why the transaction failed or why I was locked out of the account.It is my opinion that this is being done only because I wanted to send all of the funds to a wallet. Coinbase support have not been able to give me a reason for it.  I am concerned that coinbase may be another FTX and is actually insolvent.It has been my intent to move my funds to a wallet from the start.  Now I am even more concerned about using coinbase for anything.I am also contacting the SEC and FBI.  Coinbase is now regulated by the SEC as a broker/dealer and must adhere to their rules for custodial funds.  I will ask the FBI if there are any current investigations of coinbase.

I visited the support via live chat and a representative informed me that the Compliance will send me an email. A day after i received an email from the compliance asking for several documents such as source of funds, payslips, confirmation from HR that i am employed etc etc. I found it quite strange, as i did not even deposit to my coinbase, however i did provide with all required KYC documents and answered to all of their questions. After uploaded my last payslip, the Compliance asked me that they needed a bank statememt with my salary credit date. I did that as well and still my account is not vetified, as the Compliance team kept asking me for further documents. I replied that i had enough and i am not interested.

I spent hours with support to try to rectify this.The account is still locked, and I have initiated a recovery process.  Waiting for id review to come back.  Support could not give me a definitive answer as to why the transaction failed or why I was locked out of the account.It is my opinion that this is being done only because I wanted to send all of the funds to a wallet. Coinbase support have not been able to give me a reason for it.  I am concerned that coinbase may be another FTX and is actually insolvent.It has been my intent to move my funds to a wallet from the start.  Now I am even more concerned about using coinbase for anything.I am also contacting the SEC and FBI.  Coinbase is now regulated by the SEC as a broker/dealer and must adhere to their rules for custodial funds.  I will ask the FBI if there are any current investigations of coinbase.  I will see if I can file a criminal complaint with the FBI."

Positive reviews often emphasize economic benefits such as capital efficiency and currency stability. However, negative feedback focuses on regulatory challenges and market confidence issues, underscoring concerns over consumer choice and market growth. The key differentiators are the perceived economic advantages versus significant trust and regulatory concerns. To improve, there should be a focus on enhancing customer service, implementing stronger security measures, and addressing regulatory and market confidence challenges to rebuild trust and ensure sustainable growth.",

That will show you how a slick company handles On Boarding and complies with all of the required regulations. Get as good as them then ask me to rewrite the review. But don't take 3 years to reply."

Coinbase lost a large lump sum of my USDC and refused to give it back to me. I swore it would be the last time I would ever use their crappy platform but had to recently use it again because I had no other choice. They withheld my funds and insisted they were already sent to my bank account. After speaking to 20+ employees, one who is actually knowledgeable finally transferred my case to the banking department. They eventually revert the transaction back to my coinbase account but provided no explanations for where my funds went.STAY AWAY AT ALL COST PLEASE!"

Then I couldn\u2019t do anything except see my balance since the account was under review. I went through the identification submission steps with them and was told this has been completed and verified and I could start using the account again. It turned out that wasn\u2019t true. I went through this process a couple of times. Still no access. And Coinbase support refuse to tell me when I will hear back from anyone on this or whether I could be waiting indefinitely. I hope to be able to come back and update this review to something more positive if Coinbase finally resolves things but fear the only way left to gain access without waiting an underterminable period of time will be through the U.K. courts since my money effectively appears to have been stolen."

Then I couldn\u2019t do anything except see my balance since the account was under review. I went through the identification submission steps with them and was told this has been completed and verified and I could start using the account again. It turned out that wasn\u2019t true. I went through this process a couple of times. Still no access. And Coinbase support refuse to tell me when I will hear back from anyone on this or whether I could be waiting indefinitely. I hope to be able to come back and update this review to something more positive if Coinbase finally resolves things but fear the only way left to gain access without waiting an underterminable period of time will be through the U.K. courts since my money effectively appears to have been stolen."

The support does not help. I will probably be suspected of money laundering or similar insanity, which can unfortunately happen to anyone very quickly these days. Coinbase does not comment on this and simply keeps the remaining coins. It's not so much that it's worth getting a lawyer involved, but it's still simply fraud. I therefore strongly advise everyone not to store coins with Coinbase."

They claim it is for my safety, but 2 months of blocking for a transaction that has nothing to suspect of fraud. That was absurd. I will be looking for another exchange. I don't feel safe with coinbase now, as they could block it again, and I would be stuck in their hands. Chat doesn't solve anything."

The support does not help. I will probably be suspected of money laundering or similar insanity, which can unfortunately happen to anyone very quickly these days. Coinbase does not comment on this and simply keeps the remaining coins. It's not so much that it's worth getting a lawyer involved, but it's still simply fraud. I therefore strongly advise everyone not to store coins with Coinbase."

They claim it is for my safety, but 2 months of blocking for a transaction that has nothing to suspect of fraud. That was absurd. I will be looking for another exchange.

Despite 10+ emails/attempts to contact support, multiple re-uploads, begging support on Twitter, trying to teweet to the CEO on Twitter, they are still unable to find someone in the entire Coinbase company that is able to manually look at a totally valid ID.This company is completely unaccountable.Do NOT trust your business with Coinbase.

Surely something so trivial would be fixed within days? Right? It's now two months later.Despite 10+ emails/attempts to contact support, multiple re-uploads, begging support on Twitter, trying to teweet to the CEO on Twitter, they are still unable to find someone in the entire Coinbase company that is able to manually look at a totally valid ID.This company is completely unaccountable.Do NOT trust your business with Coinbase. Once you fall through the cracks in their system, their support is completely inadequate and non existent. Put your funds somewhere else. Anywhere else.Edit: After posting this review they got back to us quickly, and instead of fixing the ID issue they retaliated by just closing our account instead. Nasty, horrible company"

I mean once i got locked out of my account, and there wasn't much they could do about that, which was frustrating, but i got back in it, and it shows just how secure there platform is.  Be careful reading these reviews, Crypto is super high risk, and there are so many scammers and people out to try and get your money. 99% of the people here leaving bad reviews, clicked \"connect wallet\" somewhere they shouldn't have and someone on the internet wiped out their funds. So because they are mad about it they leave a bad review when in reality, it had nothing do do with Coinbase, and was their own fault. If you don't understand crypto, either don't get into it, or do tons of research so you understand it and can safeguard against potential losses. Personally, i have accounts on a few different exchanges, and Coinbase is the best. Coinbase One is also a really good deal, because you don't pay fees, you pay a tiny transaction fee, but like if i make a $100 purchase, in the end i have $99.90 in crypto, which is better than you will get anywhere else. All in all, Coinbase is the best. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk"

Within seconds, 8 more attempts were made with lowering amounts until it hit a number that worked.  It transferred almost all my holdings to a remote wallet not associated with me.  This was done by a bot or virus that was in their system.  I have spoken with coinbase chat folks and they have no answers and my money is gone.  I have to assume others have and will have similar problems.  They do not have a secure site and I suspect it has been infected with some automatic system that will create orders when you try to place them.

Not all my holdings were in one coin, so the attempt failed as there was not enough to cover the transaction.  Within seconds, 8 more attempts were made with lowering amounts until it hit a number that worked.  It transferred almost all my holdings to a remote wallet not associated with me.  This was done by a bot or virus that was in their system.  I have spoken with coinbase chat folks and they have no answers and my money is gone.  I have to assume others have and will have similar problems.  They do not have a secure site and I suspect it has been infected with some automatic system that will create orders when you try to place them.

Once you fall through the cracks in their system, their support is completely inadequate and non existent. Put your funds somewhere else. Anywhere else.Edit: After posting this review they got back to us quickly, and instead of fixing the ID issue they retaliated by just closing our account instead. Nasty, horrible company"

First of all, I've been trying to get support from Coinbase for 1 year, REALLY 1 YEAR.I was using a Coinbase Merchant account, I received payments in cryptocurrency from my customers and I was usually transferring to external wallets. Everything is normal until here. One day I wanted to transfer from my Coinbase Merchant account to my Coinbase account. Hold on tight, MY MONEY LOST. My money is really missing and I have been trying to get support for 1 year. There is absolutely no solution. From my Coinbase Merchant account to my Coinbase account, between 2 Coinbase services, my money disappeared. They say your account is restricted, I have spoken to KYC side 3-4 times via email. I have sent information and documents many times, they may or may not respond to an e-mail after 2 months. There is no solution there either.Live support does not offer a solution. Classic messages like we forwarded it to the team, don't worry, wait for our e-mail. I have been waiting for an e-mail since our last conversation and it has not arrived for 2 weeks.As a result, I was probably scammed. In 1 year, people create apartments, I have not received support and solutions from Coinbase in 1 year.Maybe Coinbase is good for you now, but you can understand me when you have a problem.Now they will probably ask me for a case number or something like that or they will say contact us through Coinbase. In short, empty messages. I leave my case numbers in this message: 19212767, 18627239, 17361507, 17499994, 17301559These are just the ones that caught my eye in my e-mail address.

It's an internal transfer within Coinbase. The support agent didn't even seem aware that Coinbase has a vault feature because she kept asking for the transaction # and gave me irrelevant information about transfers between Coinbase and external wallets. After 2 hours back and forth, she gave me no indication of when this transaction would go through, which was worrying and frustrating, so I ended the chat. I continue researching for hours, and eventually find out that Coinbase sends emails to every email associated with my account, and every single email needs to approve the vault withdrawal before it goes through. This is not clearly instructed anywhere, and in fact, the approval links are glitchy and the second approval will give you a popup message that says you already approved. Had the support agent actually read my short description of my problem, and knew how Coinbase vaults work, she could have helped me get this transaction moving. This was such a terrible, insensitive, unhelpful Coinbase support experience that I'll likely cancel my Coinbase One membership."

The transaction was blacked and immediately another transaction was placed for the entire amount of my balance.  Not all my holdings were in one coin, so the attempt failed as there was not enough to cover the transaction.  Within seconds, 8 more attempts were made with lowering amounts until it hit a number that worked.  It transferred almost all my holdings to a remote wallet not associated with me.  This was done by a bot or virus that was in their system.  I have spoken with coinbase chat folks and they have no answers and my money is gone.  I have to assume others have and will have similar problems.  They do not have a secure site and I suspect it has been infected with some automatic system that will create orders when you try to place them.  This came from within their system and they have no answers or solutions."

Clearly I have been discriminated against. Coinbase support take weeks to get back to users and the reply varies every time. Get a hard wallet instead and don't trust this company, they are on step away from a disguised bank."

The customer support has greatly improved and i hope i can change this review to 5star after case is resolved. UPDATE: Well they did nothing but stealing. I wish you could attach things to this review. They sent me a generic how slippage works. Got that on chat bot. They did no kind of review to see that my claim was true. Your charging slippage in your favor not as a fair way to make sure you or me doesn't get unfairly charged. Looking for another platform that doesn't steal."

Was added on both purchase and sale. In fact quite the opposite occurred. Thus company is stealing through falsely implementing 10% slippage. The customer support has greatly improved and i hope i can change this review to 5star after case is resolved. UPDATE: Well they did nothing but stealing. I wish you could attach things to this review. They sent me a generic how slippage works. Got that on chat bot. They did no kind of review to see that my claim was true. Your charging slippage in your favor not as a fair way to make sure you or me doesn't get unfairly charged. Looking for another platform that doesn't steal. See for yourself on your sell/buy every single sale or purchase is inflated beyond the true price."

Not all my holdings were in one coin, so the attempt failed as there was not enough to cover the transaction.  Within seconds, 8 more attempts were made with lowering amounts until it hit a number that worked.  It transferred almost all my holdings to a remote wallet not associated with me.  This was done by a bot or virus that was in their system.  I have spoken with coinbase chat folks and they have no answers and my money is gone.  I have to assume others have and will have similar problems.  They do not have a secure site and I suspect it has been infected with some automatic system that will create orders when you try to place them.

Was added on both purchase and sale. In fact quite the opposite occurred. Thus company is stealing through falsely implementing 10% slippage. The customer support has greatly improved and i hope i can change this review to 5star after case is resolved. UPDATE: Well they did nothing but stealing. I wish you could attach things to this review. They sent me a generic how slippage works. Got that on chat bot. They did no kind of review to see that my claim was true. Your charging slippage in your favor not as a fair way to make sure you or me doesn't get unfairly charged. Looking for another platform that doesn't steal. See for yourself on your sell/buy every single sale or purchase is inflated beyond the true price."

                "review": "If you are looking for a trustworthy exchange, use Coinbase 100%. I've been using them since 2018 and I've never had any problems. I mean once i got locked out of my account, and there wasn't much they could do about that, which was frustrating, but i got back in it, and it shows just how secure there platform is.  Be careful reading these reviews, Crypto is super high risk, and there are so many scammers and people out to try and get your money. 99% of the people here leaving bad reviews, clicked \"connect wallet\" somewhere they shouldn't have and someone on the internet wiped out their funds. So because they are mad about it they leave a bad review when in reality, it had nothing do do with Coinbase, and was their own fault. If you don't understand crypto, either don't get into it, or do tons of research so you understand it and can safeguard against potential losses. Personally, i have accounts on a few different exchanges, and Coinbase is the best. Coinbase One is also a really good deal, because you don't pay fees, you pay a tiny transaction fee, but like if i make a $100 purchase, in the end i have $99.90 in crypto, which is better than you will get anywhere else. All in all, Coinbase is the best. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk"
