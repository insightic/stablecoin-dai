To disable the function, please submit a ticket and contact customer support.\" I have immidiately created ticket #1182243. The support were only sending the default messages like i need to wait patiently and the team is working on my case. Then on 4th month of ticket they requested statements, proof of work and income. I had provided everything they have asked for.Later the error message was rephrased as \"Your account has been placed under protection due to detected potential risks. To lift this protection, please submit a ticket.\".Ticket is unsolved for 6 month already.Last reply from Gate.io in ticket was month ago. They are simply ignoring my messages or sending default one: The team is working on my issue and so on...6 months have passed but I still haven't any information about a reason of blocking, Gate.io havent explained anything.I have messaged Gate.io support via email, i had created topic on Reddit, i had messaged support in X(Twitter), tried to contact my manager via Telegram - nothing helped!!!"

Arbitrarily decline the verification and say they will freeze all assets within 7 days.They lie about tickets being submitted (say they are not from your own account so won't process them), refuse to allow transfers out below a certain amount, but say you will lose access unless you transfer your money out.Just totally geared up to steal money under the pretence of abiding by regulations (which they aren't).Update: the reply below is BS and not  reflective of how these scammers are operating. I already did KYC when I opened the account. They've asked for a new address verification, which I provided. Their response was simply that it had failed and my assets would be frozen in 7 days. Nothing about another way to verify, and no way to remove funds. Submitted a ticket. They lied when I followed up and said the ticket wasn't submitted from my account. Provided further evidence...

Once you passed that threshold, they block your withdraws in the state of \"verifying\" which is when they ask you to send them some documents to prove your identity, bank account statement blabla and thats where they never answer your emails or requests or tickets properly and keep you in this blocked state till forever no matter how much you contact them. They constantly say we will get back to you, we will review it, or they just send some irrelevant automated answers. Even these unhelpful responses each takes 1,2 days at least for you to receive which again keeps you in such blocked state forever. Its been few weeks so far and although I have sent them even more documents than what they have asked, but still no supports from them I have received. Their online chat support person tells you sth like \"oh we are so sorry, I will escalate this to our review team/ senior team blabla\" which never ever did a thing to my case and nobody got back to me. Complete scam. Avoid for sure. I'm going to claim my monies back from my credit card support as I have proof of all my communications with them already."

Arbitrarily decline the verification and say they will freeze all assets within 7 days.They lie about tickets being submitted (say they are not from your own account so won't process them), refuse to allow transfers out below a certain amount, but say you will lose access unless you transfer your money out.Just totally geared up to steal money under the pretence of abiding by regulations (which they aren't).Update: the reply below is BS and not  reflective of how these scammers are operating. I already did KYC when I opened the account. They've asked for a new address verification, which I provided. Their response was simply that it had failed and my assets would be frozen in 7 days. Nothing about another way to verify, and no way to remove funds. Submitted a ticket. They lied when I followed up and said the ticket wasn't submitted from my account. Provided further evidence...

They constantly say we will get back to you, we will review it, or they just send some irrelevant automated answers. Even these unhelpful responses each takes 1,2 days at least for you to receive which again keeps you in such blocked state forever. Its been few weeks so far and although I have sent them even more documents than what they have asked, but still no supports from them I have received. Their online chat support person tells you sth like \"oh we are so sorry, I will escalate this to our review team/ senior team blabla\" which never ever did a thing to my case and nobody got back to me.

The fact that I want to withdraw more assets in the near future is what makes it even more terrifying for me. What in other platforms takes seconds in Gate.io takes probably (? not resolved yet) more that a week (at least) and many messages.Edit: They resolved the issue!Thanks"

Since this update I have chased up and given the same automated response stating the team are yet to pick this up. To confirm this has now been going on for 4 months and still not resolved.

Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

Now 2 months on, the live chat now tell me \u2018they cannot help me anymore, the only way to contact the team on my case is to email them\u2019 - I EMAILED THEM 10/15 TIMES OVER THE PAST 4/6 WEEKS WITH NO REPLY/ NO UPDATE. So I\u2019m basically just being ignored while they have my money. I\u2019ve filled out the same questionnaire they asked for about 3 times. I\u2019ve sent them every bit of my life. And now they just say they can\u2019t help me. Im exhausted. I\u2019m depressed. I\u2019m struggling as I have a massive loan to pay. I am at a wall with this company. This is a serious amount of money for me that they have just taken from me and won\u2019t release. Do I need to say any more? I would advise to stay away at all costs , I don\u2019t wish this on anyone . And looking through reviews on this and other websites , this is happening FAR TO OFTEN. It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. Ticket number 1081360 ."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

Unbelievable Now I got message that I can't trade the USDt I bought on p2p for 24 hrs . The customer service doesn't know why. My experience not good with them . Update 1 they have even blocked my withdrawal. Working on bybit kucoin HTX as merchant I never faced such issues. My  2nd day as merchant and I already have so many issues on gate.ioIssue solved.

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

I hold my hands up and say I sent SHX tokens without a memo. Funds have now been held with Gate.io. I have provided all the requested documents and transaction information for funds to be returned. The updates the support team have given me:\u2022 The case is now with our tech team\u2022 The transfer has to be processed manually so is with the specialized team\u2022 They are really busy and request will be picked up as and whenTheses are just a few of the reasons. Most time don\u2019t even em get a response. Let me break this down another way. Believe it or not I don\u2019t this the same mistake on Uphold exchange. They resolves the matter within 48 hours. So easy for them to locate and return payment. This has been going on since November 2023. I can not believe they are just holding my money for no apparent reason. I am seeking legal advise to understand how I can have my funds returned as at this point I feel this exchange gate.io are really suspicious and would advise to stay away for simply to avoid such stress and mental health reasons. The ticket I raised is 1256841 is still not resolved. The last update was manual transaction process takes time so I just got to sit and wait. God knows how long for.

This is ridiculous, how long does it take for their \"specialist\" to figure this out. This is absurd, my friend has missed out on profits, I have missed on profits as I also made a txn to my binance, and it too under review, wanted to deposit more money.

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

I hold my hands up and say I sent SHX tokens without a memo. Funds have now been held with Gate.io. I have provided all the requested documents and transaction information for funds to be returned. The updates the support team have given me:\u2022 The case is now with our tech team\u2022 The transfer has to be processed manually so is with the specialized team\u2022 They are really busy and request will be picked up as and whenTheses are just a few of the reasons. Most time don\u2019t even em get a response. Let me break this down another way. Believe it or not I don\u2019t this the same mistake on Uphold exchange. They resolves the matter within 48 hours. So easy for them to locate and return payment. This has been going on since November 2023. I can not believe they are just holding my money for no apparent reason. I am seeking legal advise to understand how I can have my funds returned as at this point I feel this exchange gate.io are really suspicious and would advise to stay away for simply to avoid such stress and mental health reasons. The ticket I raised is 1256841 is still not resolved. The last update was manual transaction process takes time so I just got to sit and wait. God knows how long for. Please can I have some kind of a specialist from gate.io who actually knows what they are doing to review my ticket 1256841."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

Of course, the money was debited from my bank account immediately, it was so fast that you couldn't even see it. Unfortunately, the customer service is useless because apparently everyone here doesn't know what the other is doing. On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited. You should think about whether you want to stay here because when quick decisions have to be made or there is a problem, I would like more efficient problem solving."

I lost my phone and with it access to Google Authenticator linked to my gate.io account. After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I lost my phone and with it access to Google Authenticator linked to my gate.io account. After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3. Still feel customer service is poor and beware if you are from a restricted country."

I lost my phone and with it access to Google Authenticator linked to my gate.io account. After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

They couldn't care less if you lose your money or it is trapped in some coin their exchange should not have sold you in the first place. When you try to get help  the people who are offering support are either stupid or a mix of both as it is so hard to get them to do anything and they seem to think every problem int he world can be solved with a screenshot when they can't it will take you 30 minutes plus to get past this stage when trying to get them to resolve any issue at all. I have been trying to develop a automatic trading python script since Christmas 2023 and its June 2024 now. I have been putting in 18 hour days, and I'm convinced Gate dot io / Gate dot us, are very sophisticated scammer websites. This site is scamming us, every way I turn when using their site I see small clues indicating it. I really do advise go somewhere else, anywhere else, these people cannot be trusted. If your opinion differ to mine don't tell me about it, I couldn't care less. If my comments bother you so much go outside and scream at a tree about it, this is my experience with that site and it is interesting to see I am not the only one who thinks this.."

I open a new ticket and they close it immediately.Things they asked from me and things I provided: - my ID - my picture - which coins I have in my account - which coins I bought and sold - etc etc.The only thing they wanted from me and I couldn't provide:-number of a random transactionIt's unbelievable that they're making things worse because I can't provide this.

Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option.

I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

Despite numerous communications and providing all requested documentation, my account remains frozen, causing significant financial losses. Here are the details:- Income Proof: I have submitted my Payoneer income statement and a letter of good standing from Payoneer, a reputable financial institution. It seems these documents were either not received or not properly reviewed! - Credit Card Use: I have never used a credit card for transactions on your platform, only bank transfers. Therefore, the repeated requests for credit card details are irrelevant to my case! I was asked in the last EDD to attach photos of the card i have used and the transaction for it connected to your platform and i never ever used card, i have only bought with bank transfers, how come you ask me of sth which was never used ?!?!!- Questionnaire: I have completed multiple questionnaires, including the latest one ending with \"3418\". Despite this, I have not received a single meaningful response or resolution. My latest case ID is 1146911 in which i have posted a proof that my last questionaire is sent/finished. - Transaction Details: Since I have never used a credit card with Gate Connect, I can only provide details of my bank transfers! Again, you want some card transactions, and i never used a card!!!The prolonged delay in resolving this issue is unacceptable. I requested an immediate meeting to address these matters directly with the chat support and i was told that I am not with high priority and meetings were not a way of communication, so all the current communication method (chats, emails, cases) is ineffective!Your last reply did not address my concerns adequately, all issues persist, and none have been resolved.I am extremely displeased with the service I have received. My account has been locked for weeks, previous cases were closed without resolution, and I do not believe my previously submitted EDD questionnaires were ever reviewed.Gate.io, I urge you to take immediate action to resolve this issue. I need access to my funds and a proper resolution without further delay!!!!!!!"

I open a new ticket and they close it immediately.Things they asked from me and things I provided: - my ID - my picture - which coins I have in my account - which coins I bought and sold - etc etc.The only thing they wanted from me and I couldn't provide:-number of a random transactionIt's unbelievable that they're making things worse because I can't provide this. If they do not return my account within a short time, I will take legal action."

After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

Despite numerous communications and providing all requested documentation, my account remains frozen, causing significant financial losses. Here are the details:- Income Proof: I have submitted my Payoneer income statement and a letter of good standing from Payoneer, a reputable financial institution. It seems these documents were either not received or not properly reviewed! - Credit Card Use: I have never used a credit card for transactions on your platform, only bank transfers. Therefore, the repeated requests for credit card details are irrelevant to my case! I was asked in the last EDD to attach photos of the card i have used and the transaction for it connected to your platform and i never ever used card, i have only bought with bank transfers, how come you ask me of sth which was never used ?!?!!- Questionnaire: I have completed multiple questionnaires, including the latest one ending with \"3418\". Despite this, I have not received a single meaningful response or resolution. My latest case ID is 1146911 in which i have posted a proof that my last questionaire is sent/finished. - Transaction Details: Since I have never used a credit card with Gate Connect, I can only provide details of my bank transfers! Again, you want some card transactions, and i never used a card!!!The prolonged delay in resolving this issue is unacceptable. I requested an immediate meeting to address these matters directly with the chat support and i was told that I am not with high priority and meetings were not a way of communication, so all the current communication method (chats, emails, cases) is ineffective!Your last reply did not address my concerns adequately, all issues persist, and none have been resolved.I am extremely displeased with the service I have received. My account has been locked for weeks, previous cases were closed without resolution, and I do not believe my previously submitted EDD questionnaires were ever reviewed.Gate.io, I urge you to take immediate action to resolve this issue. I need access to my funds and a proper resolution without further delay!!!!!!!"

On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

It's been 4 days and still no call back. They always want harder things. I told him which coins were in my account and how much money there was, but it was still not resolved. I open a new ticket and they close it immediately.Things they asked from me and things I provided: - my ID - my picture - which coins I have in my account - which coins I bought and sold - etc etc.The only thing they wanted from me and I couldn't provide:-number of a random transactionIt's unbelievable that they're making things worse because I can't provide this. If they do not return my account within a short time, I will take legal action."

After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

Despite numerous communications and providing all requested documentation, my account remains frozen, causing significant financial losses. Here are the details:- Income Proof: I have submitted my Payoneer income statement and a letter of good standing from Payoneer, a reputable financial institution. It seems these documents were either not received or not properly reviewed! - Credit Card Use: I have never used a credit card for transactions on your platform, only bank transfers. Therefore, the repeated requests for credit card details are irrelevant to my case! I was asked in the last EDD to attach photos of the card i have used and the transaction for it connected to your platform and i never ever used card, i have only bought with bank transfers, how come you ask me of sth which was never used ?!?!!- Questionnaire: I have completed multiple questionnaires, including the latest one ending with \"3418\". Despite this, I have not received a single meaningful response or resolution. My latest case ID is 1146911 in which i have posted a proof that my last questionaire is sent/finished. - Transaction Details: Since I have never used a credit card with Gate Connect, I can only provide details of my bank transfers! Again, you want some card transactions, and i never used a card!!!The prolonged delay in resolving this issue is unacceptable. I requested an immediate meeting to address these matters directly with the chat support and i was told that I am not with high priority and meetings were not a way of communication, so all the current communication method (chats, emails, cases) is ineffective!Your last reply did not address my concerns adequately, all issues persist, and none have been resolved.I am extremely displeased with the service I have received. My account has been locked for weeks, previous cases were closed without resolution, and I do not believe my previously submitted EDD questionnaires were ever reviewed.Gate.io, I urge you to take immediate action to resolve this issue. I need access to my funds and a proper resolution without further delay!!!!!!!"

On one occasion, my problem was recorded and I was told that the senior staff would take care of it. Another time, I was told to write a ticket, but it wasn't processed even after eight days, although a repeated request to customer service assured me that the process would now be expedited.

I already sent them all the answers, documents, payslips, but receive the same questionnaire with the same list of docs again and again.For me it looks like complete scam.So be sure to avoid them.If Gate.io will prove it's legit service and unlock my money, I'll update this review.

I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

I open a new ticket and they close it immediately.Things they asked from me and things I provided: - my ID - my picture - which coins I have in my account - which coins I bought and sold - etc etc.The only thing they wanted from me and I couldn't provide:-number of a random transactionIt's unbelievable that they're making things worse because I can't provide this.

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

I already sent them all the answers, documents, payslips, but receive the same questionnaire with the same list of docs again and again.For me it looks like complete scam.So be sure to avoid them.If Gate.io will prove it's legit service and unlock my money, I'll update this review.

I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

And got it blocked.So now I'm sending their Support the same documents over and over again and see no results or resolving. I already sent them all the answers, documents, payslips, but receive the same questionnaire with the same list of docs again and again.For me it looks like complete scam.So be sure to avoid them.If Gate.io will prove it's legit service and unlock my money, I'll update this review. Until then I would strongly recommend to avoid Gate.io in every possible way!UPDATE: This scammers asked me for payslips, bank statements again, and then asked to clarify some additional info in new questionnaire. But I didn't recieve any on email and asked to resend it to me again. And you know what, today the closed the ticket. 20+ days and no results, ticket is closed.

I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3.

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

Until then I would strongly recommend to avoid Gate.io in every possible way!UPDATE: This scammers asked me for payslips, bank statements again, and then asked to clarify some additional info in new questionnaire. But I didn't recieve any on email and asked to resend it to me again. And you know what, today the closed the ticket. 20+ days and no results, ticket is closed. My money is blocked, I am scammed.Ticket number 1142011"

I have had no email correspondence prior to gate.io no longer dealing with the UK allowing my time to withdraw my funds. I now have assets on the exchange that I can not withdraw or even transfer to another exchange as I am unable to pass a security check as UK isn\u2019t an option. I can understand not allowing my account to trade in any further trades but I should be allowed to at least withdraw my funds or transfer them.I feel Gate.io have just stolen my money.Please avoid this company.Update\u2026\u2026 it took several attempts to access my funds. I had tried the below of selecting another country with no luck and found the verification option greyed out. Following this post I woke up to find my account verified and have instantly transfers to another exchange. I have therefore increased my review from 1 start to 3. Still feel customer service is poor and beware if you are from a restricted country."

The customer service apollogized and told me to wait since they have to forward the process to a specialist. After a few days they sent me a message requesting several informations:- Bank statement information about the relevant fiat currency deposit.- Proof of ownership of the bank card used for the transaction, including cardholder information.- A selfie with the bank card clearly showing the date and the account number written on a note.- An explanation of the source of funds and the purpose of the transaction.Since the case is about an onchain crypto transaction, there is no Bank involved so its not possible to give these informations. Additional i proceded several transactions of this kind beforehand without any aditional information.So i guess this is only tactics to win time and distract.After explaining this to the customer service i did not receive any further answer. Just in case they were realy talking about the fiat deposit which i executed beforehands _where they should have checked the legitimacy immediately_ i sended the requested Documents/information, which is realy not easy, since you can only upload one document.I'm waiting for nearly two weaks now.The ticket ID is: 1154131So maybe the customer service is willing to prove that gate.io is not a fraud."

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

I lost my phone and with it access to Google Authenticator linked to my gate.io account. After being fully verified by gate.io for it to unbind the authenticator in late March, they ghosted me and I did not hear from them again. That was over two months ago. Also, their verification method was so antiquated in 2024 that it was a real pain. The same issue I had was resolved by other crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken within a week after I contacted them. I thought as gate.io is registered in Cayman Islands, it would be relatively reliable. How wrong I was!!"

The customer service apollogized and told me to wait since they have to forward the process to a specialist. After a few days they sent me a message requesting several informations:- Bank statement information about the relevant fiat currency deposit.- Proof of ownership of the bank card used for the transaction, including cardholder information.- A selfie with the bank card clearly showing the date and the account number written on a note.- An explanation of the source of funds and the purpose of the transaction.Since the case is about an onchain crypto transaction, there is no Bank involved so its not possible to give these informations. Additional i proceded several transactions of this kind beforehand without any aditional information.So i guess this is only tactics to win time and distract.After explaining this to the customer service i did not receive any further answer. Just in case they were realy talking about the fiat deposit which i executed beforehands _where they should have checked the legitimacy immediately_ i sended the requested Documents/information, which is realy not easy, since you can only upload one document.I'm waiting for nearly two weaks now.The ticket ID is: 1154131So maybe the customer service is willing to prove that gate.io is not a fraud."

It\u2019s not even worth depositing a single USDT with them. I have been using Binance and depositing for years without any issues. I decided to use Gate.io once, and then this happened: About three months ago, I requested a withdrawal of 2400 USDT, which is still pending.I had to create four tickets to reach someone, and then they asked for proof of funds. I submitted all the necessary documents and have been waiting for three months, but no one responds to my tickets or inquiries.Moreover, they asked for an endless list of documents, making me feel insecure \u2013 no data protection! Everything possible: photos, credit card numbers, pay slips, registration certificates, names, passports \u2013 they demanded everything I own in terms of documents. Even photos with a selfie and the date of the withdrawal, and other ridiculous things that not even the FBI would require. It was all just an excuse to delay the withdrawal and complicate my life. But I was persistent and provided everything until they ran out of excuses. Then they simply stopped responding to my requests. The last email said, \u201cWe have forwarded your request to the relevant department.\u201d But the relevant department never responds and takes months, which seems like a lie.You have three days to respond to my tickets 1121343 and 1136953 or simply release my money, otherwise, I will involve my lawyer. What kind of fraud is this? What kind of people are you? This platform is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. I can only advise you to stay away, people. It all looks like a scam. There\u2019s no way this platform respects its customers.Lastly: You should be banned. Governments should revoke your licenses, you scammers!"

It\u2019s just not worth it. And it\u2019s not a one off, this is a regular thing with Gate.io. The worst exchange by far. Stay away, you have been warned. Their telegram group is decent. The admins always reply quickly but all they can do is \u2018push your ticket/email\u2019 after that you get an automated frustrating response and you\u2019re in no better situation.

The customer service apollogized and told me to wait since they have to forward the process to a specialist. After a few days they sent me a message requesting several informations:- Bank statement information about the relevant fiat currency deposit.- Proof of ownership of the bank card used for the transaction, including cardholder information.- A selfie with the bank card clearly showing the date and the account number written on a note.- An explanation of the source of funds and the purpose of the transaction.Since the case is about an onchain crypto transaction, there is no Bank involved so its not possible to give these informations. Additional i proceded several transactions of this kind beforehand without any aditional information.So i guess this is only tactics to win time and distract.After explaining this to the customer service i did not receive any further answer. Just in case they were realy talking about the fiat deposit which i executed beforehands _where they should have checked the legitimacy immediately_ i sended the requested Documents/information, which is realy not easy, since you can only upload one document.I'm waiting for nearly two weaks now.The ticket ID is: 1154131So maybe the customer service is willing to prove that gate.io is not a fraud."

The admins always reply quickly but all they can do is \u2018push your ticket/email\u2019 after that you get an automated frustrating response and you\u2019re in no better situation.

The customer service apollogized and told me to wait since they have to forward the process to a specialist. After a few days they sent me a message requesting several informations:- Bank statement information about the relevant fiat currency deposit.- Proof of ownership of the bank card used for the transaction, including cardholder information.- A selfie with the bank card clearly showing the date and the account number written on a note.- An explanation of the source of funds and the purpose of the transaction.Since the case is about an onchain crypto transaction, there is no Bank involved so its not possible to give these informations. Additional i proceded several transactions of this kind beforehand without any aditional information.So i guess this is only tactics to win time and distract.After explaining this to the customer service i did not receive any further answer. Just in case they were realy talking about the fiat deposit which i executed beforehands _where they should have checked the legitimacy immediately_ i sended the requested Documents/information, which is realy not easy, since you can only upload one document.I'm waiting for nearly two weaks now.The ticket ID is: 1154131So maybe the customer service is willing to prove that gate.io is not a fraud."

They have blocked my funds without any explenation. Asking for the same documents multiple times which i provided every time. But each time they use excuses or don't even open the filles i send. And when i'm in the live chat (almost daily) they only tell me to 'wait'.I have honestly never written down a review since i don't like waisting my time. But this is the first time. Please do not use this exchange - customer service is -0."

After god knows how many days and completely frustrating you (not to mention the potential losses you will occur as you\u2019re unable to trade) if you\u2019re lucky you MIGHT get a refund. It\u2019s just not worth it. And it\u2019s not a one off, this is a regular thing with Gate.io. The worst exchange by far. Stay away, you have been warned. Their telegram group is decent. The admins always reply quickly but all they can do is \u2018push your ticket/email\u2019 after that you get an automated frustrating response and you\u2019re in no better situation. They have over $6,000 of mine and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting it back. What can you do? Nothing! Hence I said, you\u2019ve been warned."

The customer service apollogized and told me to wait since they have to forward the process to a specialist. After a few days they sent me a message requesting several informations:- Bank statement information about the relevant fiat currency deposit.- Proof of ownership of the bank card used for the transaction, including cardholder information.- A selfie with the bank card clearly showing the date and the account number written on a note.- An explanation of the source of funds and the purpose of the transaction.Since the case is about an onchain crypto transaction, there is no Bank involved so its not possible to give these informations. Additional i proceded several transactions of this kind beforehand without any aditional information.So i guess this is only tactics to win time and distract.After explaining this to the customer service i did not receive any further answer. Just in case they were realy talking about the fiat deposit which i executed beforehands _where they should have checked the legitimacy immediately_ i sended the requested Documents/information, which is realy not easy, since you can only upload one document.I'm waiting for nearly two weaks now.The ticket ID is: 1154131So maybe the customer service is willing to prove that gate.io is not a fraud."

They have blocked my funds without any explenation. Asking for the same documents multiple times which i provided every time. But each time they use excuses or don't even open the filles i send. And when i'm in the live chat (almost daily) they only tell me to 'wait'.I have honestly never written down a review since i don't like waisting my time. But this is the first time.

The customer service apollogized and told me to wait since they have to forward the process to a specialist. After a few days they sent me a message requesting several informations:- Bank statement information about the relevant fiat currency deposit.- Proof of ownership of the bank card used for the transaction, including cardholder information.- A selfie with the bank card clearly showing the date and the account number written on a note.- An explanation of the source of funds and the purpose of the transaction.Since the case is about an onchain crypto transaction, there is no Bank involved so its not possible to give these informations. Additional i proceded several transactions of this kind beforehand without any aditional information.So i guess this is only tactics to win time and distract.After explaining this to the customer service i did not receive any further answer. Just in case they were realy talking about the fiat deposit which i executed beforehands _where they should have checked the legitimacy immediately_ i sended the requested Documents/information, which is realy not easy, since you can only upload one document.I'm waiting for nearly two weaks now.The ticket ID is: 1154131So maybe the customer service is willing to prove that gate.io is not a fraud."

After god knows how many days and completely frustrating you (not to mention the potential losses you will occur as you\u2019re unable to trade) if you\u2019re lucky you MIGHT get a refund. It\u2019s just not worth it. And it\u2019s not a one off, this is a regular thing with Gate.io. The worst exchange by far. Stay away, you have been warned. Their telegram group is decent. The admins always reply quickly but all they can do is \u2018push your ticket/email\u2019 after that you get an automated frustrating response and you\u2019re in no better situation. They have over $6,000 of mine and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting it back. What can you do? Nothing! Hence I said, you\u2019ve been warned."

In response I received a letter again to provide data on transactions!!! and so on to infinity. it feels like no one there does not even read what you send them, and send standard letters with the same words. more than a week withdrawals are not working. i worked with different exchanges, any problems were solved in a couple of days.

Also why you accept to transfer from my bank to gateio but block my transfer without reason.I have all proof that this unexpected and unclear blockage made me lose my money. If you did not stop transfer i could not lose my money. Gateio operate in Europe countries and you can not block money without no reason which transfered by bank in EU so do not accept before.

If you did not stop transfer i could not lose my money. Gateio operate in Europe countries and you can not block money without no reason which transfered by bank in EU so do not accept before.

I provided all screenshots, documents, confirmation of income earned, but the exchange refuses to unfreeze my funds. They say that on the screenshots should be the sender's address, recipient's address and tx id of the transaction, but all these data are present on the screenshots! They have a standard response to my emails. I am a law-abiding citizen who pays all taxes from trading.

Also why you accept to transfer from my bank to gateio but block my transfer without reason.I have all proof that this unexpected and unclear blockage made me lose my money. If you did not stop transfer i could not lose my money. Gateio operate in Europe countries and you can not block money without no reason which transfered by bank in EU so do not accept before.

I provided all screenshots, documents, confirmation of income earned, but the exchange refuses to unfreeze my funds. They say that on the screenshots should be the sender's address, recipient's address and tx id of the transaction, but all these data are present on the screenshots! They have a standard response to my emails. I am a law-abiding citizen who pays all taxes from trading.

If you did not stop transfer i could not lose my money. Gateio operate in Europe countries and you can not block money without no reason which transfered by bank in EU so do not accept before.

If you did not stop transfer i could not lose my money. Gateio operate in Europe countries and you can not block money without no reason which transfered by bank in EU so do not accept before. I want my blocked also lost money because of you.I will apply for klagom\u00e5lscentral in Sweden if i dont get my moneyticket #1371448"

Also why you accept to transfer from my bank to gateio but block my transfer without reason.I have all proof that this unexpected and unclear blockage made me lose my money. If you did not stop transfer i could not lose my money. Gateio operate in Europe countries and you can not block money without no reason which transfered by bank in EU so do not accept before.

The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient.

To improve, TRON should focus on enhancing customer service, ensuring transparent pricing, and addressing withdrawal issues to rebuild trust and credibility with its users.

It\u2019s been 9 months. How much more time do you need. Has the same issue with another exchange and refund was done within 2 days. I just don\u2019t understand what the hold up is.

But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient.

To lodge a support ticket , you have to be logged into your account.  They provide no alternate to google 2FA not working due to system issue on their side.   In essence you are locked out of your account and have no access to your funds.   After a lengthy process , managed to contact support as a guest.  They provided me a link to to remove  my google 2FA connection. However, this requires a cumbersome ID verify that was previously completed.  You have to take pictures holding a sign etc.   You will not have this issue with reputable exchanges like coinex or coinspot etc.   Stay away from this service."

Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient.

In essence you are locked out of your account and have no access to your funds.   After a lengthy process , managed to contact support as a guest.  They provided me a link to to remove  my google 2FA connection. However, this requires a cumbersome ID verify that was previously completed.  You have to take pictures holding a sign etc.   You will not have this issue with reputable exchanges like coinex or coinspot etc.   Stay away from this service."

All I get from the support team is your request has been sent to the processing team to refund. So I chase up every day and tell me the same thing which is be patient refunds take time. It\u2019s been 9 months. How much more time do you need. Has the same issue with another exchange and refund was done within 2 days. I just don\u2019t understand what the hold up is.

The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient. The support process can be slow, and the lack of communication is frustrating, but in the end, Gate.io is a platform you can trust to get your money back."

The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient. The support process can be slow, and the lack of communication is frustrating, but in the end, Gate.io is a platform you can trust to get your money back."

It\u2019s been 9 months. How much more time do you need. Has the same issue with another exchange and refund was done within 2 days. I just don\u2019t understand what the hold up is.

But in the end, Gate.io turned out to be a reliable platform that actually cares about its users.It took a whole 90 days to get my money back\u2014trust me, it felt like forever\u2014but Gate.io\u2019s support team did manage to recover my funds. The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient. The support process can be slow, and the lack of communication is frustrating, but in the end, Gate.io is a platform you can trust to get your money back."

Yesterday I bought 1,500 usdt with my credit card using their third party gateway (MoonPay). After MoonPay confirmed the payment and transfered the coins to gate.io, I wanted to withdraw them to my OKX account. Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

Yesterday I bought 1,500 usdt with my credit card using their third party gateway (MoonPay). After MoonPay confirmed the payment and transfered the coins to gate.io, I wanted to withdraw them to my OKX account. Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

As a p2p seller, I was falsely accused of misconduct in a transaction, and the customer support was biased, unhelpful, and unprofessional. They ignored clear evidence, pressured me to log into an account I didn't own, and sided with the buyer, who acted irresponsibly by following instructions from an unverified source.The support team, especially Jaylie and P2P_Aria, were dismissive and driven by emotions rather than facts. They threatened to release funds to the buyer despite my legitimate proof. To make matters worse, they completely ignored my email and ticket, leaving me with no resolution. The platform's handling of disputes is abysmal, putting sellers at a huge risk. I wouldn\u2019t trust Gate.io with any transactions again. Don\u2019t make the mistake of joining this platform\u2014your money and peace of mind are at risk!my ticket: 1195154my uid: 16965437"

Yesterday I bought 1,500 usdt with my credit card using their third party gateway (MoonPay). After MoonPay confirmed the payment and transfered the coins to gate.io, I wanted to withdraw them to my OKX account. Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

In essence you are locked out of your account and have no access to your funds.   After a lengthy process , managed to contact support as a guest.  They provided me a link to to remove  my google 2FA connection. However, this requires a cumbersome ID verify that was previously completed.

They threatened to release funds to the buyer despite my legitimate proof. To make matters worse, they completely ignored my email and ticket, leaving me with no resolution.

Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

                "review": "I swear to God... these guys are THE WORSE! I have over 11 years in crypto and I have never ever seen such unprofessional behavior! They are repeatedly asking for bank statements, selfies, and such, despite you already provided them. I will give you an example. I am buying stable coin, then I am trying to withdraw, but they wouldn't allow the transaction. They are then requesting bank statements for the past 8 MONTHS, selfie with the card and statement for the particular transaction. But guess what? This transaction is on hold like every other recent transaction! You cannot provide a statement for a transaction that is on hold and you normally give them a screenshot from your banking, but they wouldn't accept it. I even send them 2 selfies with bank card and my personal ID as additional proof, but no. And guess what? It happens to me for a 3rd time this year! Last two times I waited 4 and 5 days each, now I am waiting for a 3rd day. I was to buy altcoins with the stablecoins I bought from them and grand total loss is over $2,000 (for not buying on time, and they went up). Previous time they hold a transaction for like $1,500. I then tried to withdraw another like $100, but naturally it didn't work. I started talking with their support, they tortured me for 5 days and at the end they were like \"Hey, good news... we released your funds.\". You go back and check to see that your $100 are transferred, but not the $1,500. You go back to them and explain that everything started with the $1,500 and guess what? They ask you again for bank statements, selfies, pics of your girlfriend, mother, sister... Can you imagine the stupidity of this?! And all this despite you are KYC'd on the exchange years ago and you have used same bank account before. And you proved it's yours before! UNBELIAVABLE! Every time you try to talk with their \"support\", they'd send you some prepared answer (template) to \"please wait patiently\" like you are an idiot! THE WORSE GUYS, THE WORSE! AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE!"

After MoonPay confirmed the payment and transfered the coins to gate.io, I wanted to withdraw them to my OKX account. Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient.

They are then requesting bank statements for the past 8 MONTHS, selfie with the card and statement for the particular transaction. But guess what? This transaction is on hold like every other recent transaction! You cannot provide a statement for a transaction that is on hold and you normally give them a screenshot from your banking, but they wouldn't accept it. I even send them 2 selfies with bank card and my personal ID as additional proof, but no. And guess what? It happens to me for a 3rd time this year! Last two times I waited 4 and 5 days each, now I am waiting for a 3rd day. I was to buy altcoins with the stablecoins I bought from them and grand total loss is over $2,000 (for not buying on time, and they went up). Previous time they hold a transaction for like $1,500. I then tried to withdraw another like $100, but naturally it didn't work. I started talking with their support, they tortured me for 5 days and at the end they were like \"Hey, good news... we released your funds.\". You go back and check to see that your $100 are transferred, but not the $1,500. You go back to them and explain that everything started with the $1,500 and guess what? They ask you again for bank statements, selfies, pics of your girlfriend, mother, sister... Can you imagine the stupidity of this?! And all this despite you are KYC'd on the exchange years ago and you have used same bank account before. And you proved it's yours before! UNBELIAVABLE! Every time you try to talk with their \"support\", they'd send you some prepared answer (template) to \"please wait patiently\" like you are an idiot! THE WORSE GUYS, THE WORSE! AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE!"

Yesterday I bought 1,500 usdt with my credit card using their third party gateway (MoonPay). After MoonPay confirmed the payment and transfered the coins to gate.io, I wanted to withdraw them to my OKX account. Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient. The support process can be slow, and the lack of communication is frustrating, but in the end, Gate.io is a platform you can trust to get your money back."

Yesterday I bought 1,500 usdt with my credit card using their third party gateway (MoonPay). After MoonPay confirmed the payment and transfered the coins to gate.io, I wanted to withdraw them to my OKX account. Four hours later I contacted the support because the withdraw was still verifying and they told me I have to send a picture of me with the credit card and a written text and some more documents to their mail address. I answered them that the credit card is a virtual card and for security reasons I can\u00b4t send my documents by mail. The answer from them was that then I\u00b4ll not receive my coins neither the withdraw will be canceled, it will stucks in \"verifying\".For me that\u00b4s a scam as 1. I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

After our review, can we return the funds to the address you used to send them? If that's acceptable, please reply to let us know. Should you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for choosing Gate.io. Have a great day!Best Regards,Oleg\u2019The reason I am deeply annoyed and concerned is this has now gone on for over 11 months. Close to 1 year and my money has not been returned. Sadly there is a big requirement for the money as this is now urgently required to cover family members medical bill for treatment which is now a matter of life and death. Please Gate.io I ask that someone within your company understands the urgency in this matter and return my money to cover these costs. I do not want to simply get a generic message as I always do and have done for 11 months saying this is being looking into by the relevant department. As nothing gets done. I will update this review based on resolution. I have raised multiple tickets and have been ignored.   The new ticket raised is 1399328. The ticket which has been ongoing for months is 1354619"

The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient. The support process can be slow, and the lack of communication is frustrating, but in the end, Gate.io is a platform you can trust to get your money back."

They are repeatedly asking for bank statements, selfies, and such, despite you already provided them. I will give you an example. I am buying stable coin, then I am trying to withdraw, but they wouldn't allow the transaction. They are then requesting bank statements for the past 8 MONTHS, selfie with the card and statement for the particular transaction. But guess what? This transaction is on hold like every other recent transaction! You cannot provide a statement for a transaction that is on hold and you normally give them a screenshot from your banking, but they wouldn't accept it. I even send them 2 selfies with bank card and my personal ID as additional proof, but no. And guess what? It happens to me for a 3rd time this year! Last two times I waited 4 and 5 days each, now I am waiting for a 3rd day. I was to buy altcoins with the stablecoins I bought from them and grand total loss is over $2,000 (for not buying on time, and they went up). Previous time they hold a transaction for like $1,500. I then tried to withdraw another like $100, but naturally it didn't work. I started talking with their support, they tortured me for 5 days and at the end they were like \"Hey, good news... we released your funds.\". You go back and check to see that your $100 are transferred, but not the $1,500. You go back to them and explain that everything started with the $1,500 and guess what? They ask you again for bank statements, selfies, pics of your girlfriend, mother, sister... Can you imagine the stupidity of this?! And all this despite you are KYC'd on the exchange years ago and you have used same bank account before. And you proved it's yours before! UNBELIAVABLE! Every time you try to talk with their \"support\", they'd send you some prepared answer (template) to \"please wait patiently\" like you are an idiot! THE WORSE GUYS, THE WORSE! AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE!"

After our review, can we return the funds to the address you used to send them? If that's acceptable, please reply to let us know. Should you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for choosing Gate.io. Have a great day!Best Regards,Oleg\u2019The reason I am deeply annoyed and concerned is this has now gone on for over 11 months. Close to 1 year and my money has not been returned. Sadly there is a big requirement for the money as this is now urgently required to cover family members medical bill for treatment which is now a matter of life and death. Please Gate.io I ask that someone within your company understands the urgency in this matter and return my money to cover these costs. I do not want to simply get a generic message as I always do and have done for 11 months saying this is being looking into by the relevant department. As nothing gets done. I will update this review based on resolution. I have raised multiple tickets and have been ignored.   The new ticket raised is 1399328. The ticket which has been ongoing for months is 1354619"

I didn\u00b4t bought the coins from them so there\u00b4s no reason to ask me for my credit card, and 2. why should I send my documents by mail if I did all my KYC with them?Order-ID: 62417175Ticket-ID: 1193673"

But in the end, Gate.io turned out to be a reliable platform that actually cares about its users.It took a whole 90 days to get my money back\u2014trust me, it felt like forever\u2014but Gate.io\u2019s support team did manage to recover my funds. The hardest part was how little they communicated with me during the process. Most of the time, I had no idea what they were doing, and that made the wait even more stressful.Dealing with their support wasn\u2019t easy\u2014communication was often unclear, and it was hard to not know what was going on. But even with these frustrations, I can say that Gate.io is a safe platform. They could have easily ignored my case, but they didn\u2019t. That shows they really do care about helping users, even if they don\u2019t always keep you in the loop.If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just be patient. The support process can be slow, and the lack of communication is frustrating, but in the end, Gate.io is a platform you can trust to get your money back."

Other operations such as convert and crypto withdrawal are very smooth. I don't know what's wrong with their flat currency withdrawal. Anyway I'll use a local Finnish provider for that and keep my gate account for crypto trades and deposits."

They respond here so they seem legit, but it's just a big scam.-- edit : as you can see, they do not care at all, the ticket number is in the review below, they do not care at all about their customers. Again they only reply herre so they look honest and legit, but nothing happens with the support ticket !!"

                "review": "I swear to God... these guys are THE WORSE! I have over 11 years in crypto and I have never ever seen such unprofessional behavior! They are repeatedly asking for bank statements, selfies, and such, despite you already provided them. I will give you an example. I am buying stable coin, then I am trying to withdraw, but they wouldn't allow the transaction. They are then requesting bank statements for the past 8 MONTHS, selfie with the card and statement for the particular transaction. But guess what? This transaction is on hold like every other recent transaction! You cannot provide a statement for a transaction that is on hold and you normally give them a screenshot from your banking, but they wouldn't accept it. I even send them 2 selfies with bank card and my personal ID as additional proof, but no. And guess what? It happens to me for a 3rd time this year! Last two times I waited 4 and 5 days each, now I am waiting for a 3rd day. I was to buy altcoins with the stablecoins I bought from them and grand total loss is over $2,000 (for not buying on time, and they went up). Previous time they hold a transaction for like $1,500. I then tried to withdraw another like $100, but naturally it didn't work. I started talking with their support, they tortured me for 5 days and at the end they were like \"Hey, good news... we released your funds.\". You go back and check to see that your $100 are transferred, but not the $1,500. You go back to them and explain that everything started with the $1,500 and guess what? They ask you again for bank statements, selfies, pics of your girlfriend, mother, sister... Can you imagine the stupidity of this?! And all this despite you are KYC'd on the exchange years ago and you have used same bank account before. And you proved it's yours before! UNBELIAVABLE! Every time you try to talk with their \"support\", they'd send you some prepared answer (template) to \"please wait patiently\" like you are an idiot! THE WORSE GUYS, THE WORSE! AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE!"
