After trying different methods of payments for over two hours, I get a huge questionnaire to upload bank statements, pictures, ID cards... around 15-20 questions. After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning. I am not dealing with huge amounts of cash, I am just learning the crypto world. Stop SCAMMING people and let them use their own money."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

The fact that they stop withdrawals when they want to, until they want to, without giving a specific date, that's already a scam to me. No wonder they're not available in US, UK and Canada."

Then, if you want to withdraw only a part, they block you. It means you can\u2019t access your money you invested. Not only about profits, even not your initial funds. After they tell you that you wan in a reward some thousands of dollars, in my case over 300\u2019000. But they ask first to pay 50\u2019000 to the access to your funds and then also the reward of 300\u2019000. Guess what happens if you pay 50\u2019000. Nothing. Maybe another excuse for another fee to pay to get access to what belongs to you. Absolutely fraudulent if a platform blocks access to your funds you paid and invested."

Its just absurd, obviuosly they don't want me to close the account, because this is the only reason why I want to withdraw the money. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

Security concerns also emerge as a critical issue from the negative reviews, suggesting that the platform may need to bolster its security measures to enhance user trust. The mixed average rating of 2.67 reflects this polarization in user sentiment. Areas for potential improvement include simplifying the user interface to cater to less technically proficient users and enhancing customer support to address user issues more effectively. Further investigation could be beneficial to understand the specific security vulnerabilities and to develop strategies to mitigate them, ensuring a more consistent and secure user experience.",

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

From the get-go, the platform's simplicity made diving into crypto trading a breeze, even for a newbie like me. Deposits and withdrawals have been a non-issue, which is a breath of fresh air in an industry where such transactions can sometimes be nerve-wracking. Plus, whenever I've had a question, their customer support team has been lightning-fast in their responses, making me feel genuinely valued as a user. Overall, Bitget has made my crypto journey smooth sailing, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly platform."

Educational initiatives are highlighted, reflecting an awareness of the need to improve understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency technologies among the broader public.

After completing it and proving my legitimate use of this app, they still require prove of the transaction certificate of the person I am sending the money to. This is their private information, and if there is an issue with them, you should be contacting them, not keeping my money hostage. This is not a way to make my account more secure, this is a way to SCAM me and keep my money. I am very new to this, and I am only learning.

Despite following their Support's directions to maintain said positions which ended up getting liquidated a day later, they refused to compensate my position based on my Stop Loss which did not automatically terminate the position as intended, even though on multiple replies that they've acknowledged an issue with their setting and is currently undergoing changes. Also, despite having a transcript of the dialogue that clearly documented their instructions, their Support first denied the existence of said conversation, but later simply ignored the fact when I referred to the dialogue and simply blamed the losses on the customer saying I couldn't closed it myself any time. Then my request to have the case referred to a senior manager was also ignored, and all I received were cut-n-paste scripts by their low level Support staff that was abrupt and unhelpful. Finally, even though my losses is equivalent to probably less than a minute of their trading fees, and much less than free bonuses that they give out to new customers, which I suggested that they can use on my case since I'm also a new joiner, they simply refused and again use their copy/paste script on their replies. I've realized that Bitget is only interested in taking new users' funds for their own gains and provides zero support even when the issue lies with their platform. Moreover, they put flaky tools/products on their platform for unknowing customers to use that will jeopardize their funds, only to later blame the user. Be warned!!!"

I wrote many emails to inform the other party, and each time the other party responded by asking me to provide the transaction ID and wallet address. Then I went to their community to find their community staff to tell them about what happened to me, and their community staff directly banned me. I changed my identity and went into the community to complain, but was banned again. Recently, the bitget wallet suddenly sent me an email to respond that the bitget wallet would not compensate my losses, and the reason was that  Maybe I leaked my private password, or other unknown problems led to my fund loss. I would like to ask your platform, why didn\u2019t you steal my money? In addition to you, who else has the ability to make my money disappear within an hour of my first transfer to your platform? I don\u2019t believe anyone would pay attention to an account that has no previous transaction records, and no one has the ability to steal my funds as soon as they are transferred to your platform without any previous transaction records. So it is more likely that your platform stole my $1,600 in virtual currency, or it was one of your insiders."

I wrote many emails to inform the other party, and each time the other party responded by asking me to provide the transaction ID and wallet address. Then I went to their community to find their community staff to tell them about what happened to me, and their community staff directly banned me. I changed my identity and went into the community to complain, but was banned again. Recently, the bitget wallet suddenly sent me an email to respond that the bitget wallet would not compensate my losses, and the reason was that  Maybe I leaked my private password, or other unknown problems led to my fund loss. I would like to ask your platform, why didn\u2019t you steal my money? In addition to you, who else has the ability to make my money disappear within an hour of my first transfer to your platform? I don\u2019t believe anyone would pay attention to an account that has no previous transaction records, and no one has the ability to steal my funds as soon as they are transferred to your platform without any previous transaction records. So it is more likely that your platform stole my $1,600 in virtual currency, or it was one of your insiders."

I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!!

I have provided all of the information which they have requested i.e. three months bank statements, passport, copies of the front and back of the debit card which I used to fund my account but yet  upon all of this they keep deliberately and on purpose running me around in cycles and asking me to \u2018be patient\u2019 simply because they do not want to give me my money back!  They are evil.  They are trying to wear me out and hope that I eventually forget about my investment. AVOID BITGET AT ALL COSTS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f. THEY ARE ROBBING AND SCAMMING PEOPLE.  IF YOU INVEST YOUR MONEY YOU WILL LOSE IT!!! If I could give these evil people/company a -10 out of 10 I would. Pure wickedness!

I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!!

And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!!

I fill out a torturously long questionnaire that wants my tax info, bank statements, employment information, etc. etc. plus a letter assuming all accountability for transactions.

I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!! Absolutely appalling, please I\u2019m telling you, stay far far away from this exchange and never use this useless app!!!!"

The app said it was \u2018processing\u2019 the withdrawal but I never received anything. I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!! Absolutely appalling, please I\u2019m telling you, stay far far away from this exchange and never use this useless app!!!!"

I have provided all of the information which they have requested i.e. three months bank statements, passport, copies of the front and back of the debit card which I used to fund my account but yet  upon all of this they keep deliberately and on purpose running me around in cycles and asking me to \u2018be patient\u2019 simply because they do not want to give me my money back!  They are evil.  They are trying to wear me out and hope that I eventually forget about my investment. AVOID BITGET AT ALL COSTS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f.

The app said it was \u2018processing\u2019 the withdrawal but I never received anything. I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!! Absolutely appalling, please I\u2019m telling you, stay far far away from this exchange and never use this useless app!!!!"

The app said it was \u2018processing\u2019 the withdrawal but I never received anything. I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!! Absolutely appalling, please I\u2019m telling you, stay far far away from this exchange and never use this useless app!!!!"

                "review": "Do not use bitget. My first problem was when I was trying to withdraw some ltc to an external wallet. The app said it was \u2018processing\u2019 the withdrawal but I never received anything. I had to constantly go back and forth with the appalling support to try and get my very own funds and eventually got it sorted after over 24 hours for a process that should\u2019ve taken 10 mins max!! Now for the next problem, I bought \u00a3850 worth of btc, and when I tried to withdraw it, it said that my account was frozen and to contact support! And upon doing so I was told I would get an email back on the issue within 48 hours. Once I got this email, they were asking for details of the receiver and the purpose of one of my transactions from months ago for a mere 15 usdt. I told them that I was sending it to a friend to pay them back, then they asked me for some sort of proof of debt which is absolutely none of their business!!! I told them that I couldn\u2019t provide as it was months ago and I got a new phone and on top of that, most of our conversations are face to face in real life, then I got an email saying that my account will be restricted and my hard earned money locked while they do an account review for a whopping 15 DAYS!!! Absolutely appalling, please I\u2019m telling you, stay far far away from this exchange and never use this useless app!!!!"

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam.

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam.

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam.

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam.

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam.

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam.

After returning that amount, they provided $2,000, which was then converted to $4,000, and the cycle continued. They gave her an app resembling Kogan, a fake website with bogus targets to make it seem like she was working for a legitimate company. Some women, acting as mentors, were also part of this scam, including someone named Sandygate, who pressured her into participating. Unfortunately, we lost nearly 14,000 AUD in this scam. Please stay vigilant and report such incidents to your nearest police authorities."

But then, when I tried to withdraw my earnings, that's when the problems started.

It was a real headache and made me question if I should continue using the platform. However, I decided to give it another chance and hope that these issues get sorted out in the future."

Positive feedback highlights TRON's growth, market analysis, and industry insights, particularly noting its adoption trends and investor confidence. However, negative reviews dominate, consistently criticizing poor customer service, issues with trust, manipulated prices, and difficulties with withdrawals, often labeling the company as scammers. This dichotomy suggests that while TRON is seen as a strong performer in the market, its customer relations and operational transparency are significant areas of concern. To improve, TRON should focus on enhancing customer service, ensuring transparent operations, and addressing trust issues to align its market performance with customer satisfaction.",

They get locked out of their Bitget accounts and Gianna and the professor tell them to deposit more funds in order for Bitget to unlock their accounts.

Potential areas for improvement include enhancing performance measurement tools and ensuring greater transparency and security in stablecoin transactions to foster trust and stability in the market.",

I keep getting different answers to why, first they tell me the total profit is without funding fees. Then i want them to send me list of funding fees and then i find out that the total profit i can see is including funding fees. I am making a nice profit but i am missing some of it and i want to understand if i can count on the total profit or not. Because 40 % less is not a small percentage that\u2019s a LOT. Everytime i get an answer on the mail it\u2019s by a new person and we just go around in a loop we are going nowhere. I 1 person to seriously help me out and figure this out and i will change my 1 star to 5. This is not acceptable behaviour by a company as yours. 7054486209 Should be a number you can search on the system for my case or something."

To reduce the risk associated with centralized exchanges, I decided to split my funds between Bitget and my previous exchange, thinking it would be safer in case one of them went bankrupt.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a very bad decision. A few weeks after opening my account, Bitget froze it without any explanation. It has now been over a week, and customer service keeps telling me they cannot disclose the reason, asking me to wait. I also had USDT in my account, which I intended to use to buy some cryptocurrencies, but now I can\u2019t do anything because my account has been restricted for no apparent reason. I am confident I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.I initially thought Bitget was a reliable centralized exchange, but based on my experience, it\u2019s proven to be the opposite. My friends use various other centralized exchanges, and none of them have had this kind of problem."

In the process, they convince traders to invest more and for those who fall for this scam,  they never see their money again. They get locked out of their Bitget accounts and Gianna and the professor tell them to deposit more funds in order for Bitget to unlock their accounts. There is no way they can contact support for help. My niece was the latest victim. Be warned!"

To reduce the risk associated with centralized exchanges, I decided to split my funds between Bitget and my previous exchange, thinking it would be safer in case one of them went bankrupt.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a very bad decision. A few weeks after opening my account, Bitget froze it without any explanation. It has now been over a week, and customer service keeps telling me they cannot disclose the reason, asking me to wait. I also had USDT in my account, which I intended to use to buy some cryptocurrencies, but now I can\u2019t do anything because my account has been restricted for no apparent reason. I am confident I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.I initially thought Bitget was a reliable centralized exchange, but based on my experience, it\u2019s proven to be the opposite. My friends use various other centralized exchanges, and none of them have had this kind of problem."

To reduce the risk associated with centralized exchanges, I decided to split my funds between Bitget and my previous exchange, thinking it would be safer in case one of them went bankrupt.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a very bad decision. A few weeks after opening my account, Bitget froze it without any explanation. It has now been over a week, and customer service keeps telling me they cannot disclose the reason, asking me to wait. I also had USDT in my account, which I intended to use to buy some cryptocurrencies, but now I can\u2019t do anything because my account has been restricted for no apparent reason. I am confident I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.I initially thought Bitget was a reliable centralized exchange, but based on my experience, it\u2019s proven to be the opposite. My friends use various other centralized exchanges, and none of them have had this kind of problem."

Then i want them to send me list of funding fees and then i find out that the total profit i can see is including funding fees. I am making a nice profit but i am missing some of it and i want to understand if i can count on the total profit or not. Because 40 % less is not a small percentage that\u2019s a LOT. Everytime i get an answer on the mail it\u2019s by a new person and we just go around in a loop we are going nowhere.

This telegram account asked me to send them the tokens (Which I didn't want to do, but at this point was left with no other option), after sending the tokens the team promised to send me my tokens in a few days, its now been weeks, they've stopped replying to my messages and clearly aren't going to remunerate me.

It is like a trap my money got in and I can take it out. I am extremely annoyed. I need my money asap. The email has never come, not even in the spam. The link you sent me, I spoke to an agent who just directed me to their telegram channel, which I can not talk to anyone again. No HELP again. You have an application that you can not recover the PIN code. No one helps to make the withdrawal. I need my money."

To reduce the risk associated with centralized exchanges, I decided to split my funds between Bitget and my previous exchange, thinking it would be safer in case one of them went bankrupt.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a very bad decision. A few weeks after opening my account, Bitget froze it without any explanation. It has now been over a week, and customer service keeps telling me they cannot disclose the reason, asking me to wait. I also had USDT in my account, which I intended to use to buy some cryptocurrencies, but now I can\u2019t do anything because my account has been restricted for no apparent reason. I am confident I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.I initially thought Bitget was a reliable centralized exchange, but based on my experience, it\u2019s proven to be the opposite. My friends use various other centralized exchanges, and none of them have had this kind of problem."

Bitget's customer service are absolutely useless, they pass you from email to live chat and back and forth in an endless loop. This exchange is unscrupulous, untrustworthy and unprofessional."

It is like a trap my money got in and I can take it out. I am extremely annoyed. I need my money asap. The email has never come, not even in the spam. The link you sent me, I spoke to an agent who just directed me to their telegram channel, which I can not talk to anyone again. No HELP again. You have an application that you can not recover the PIN code. No one helps to make the withdrawal. I need my money."

This telegram account asked me to send them the tokens (Which I didn't want to do, but at this point was left with no other option), after sending the tokens the team promised to send me my tokens in a few days, its now been weeks, they've stopped replying to my messages and clearly aren't going to remunerate me. Bitget's customer service are absolutely useless, they pass you from email to live chat and back and forth in an endless loop. This exchange is unscrupulous, untrustworthy and unprofessional."

I also tried to create a new account and I keep getting \u201cyour account is susceptible to high risk, please contact customer support\u201d, of which I tried to, but that also proved abortive. I also asked someone to help open an account from their end and see if it would work. The person was able to open a new account, but when it was time to login, he was getting the \u201cincorrect password\u201d prompt. Please, you guys should do something about it. I have a little asset in the wallet and the wallet is also connected to some of my airdrops. So please do something about it.My uid is : 9b10778d63b086947bf3db795badc9cdThank you"

Beyond that, if I ask any further questions, they simply send me a feedback request form without providing any actual responses. Are they trolling us? Since they haven\u2019t provided any answers, I don\u2019t see how they can be fairly evaluated. All I can say is: 0 stars, and that\u2019s it.Customer support (which seems more like a suppression unit) remains silent\u2014ignoring inquiries entirely.In the AMPL case, they froze our funds for three weeks, then retroactively took away our past realized profits and harmed customers through the AMPL rebase. They left the \"no-rebase\" product incomplete for two years, then suddenly changed the rules without giving customers a choice. This is clearly a conflict of interest.They avoid accountability and show no sincerity.When the recent BGB flash crash occurred, the company announced they would fully compensate customers for their losses, emphasizing \"trust.\" Perhaps this was because their losses weren\u2019t that large.However, in the case of a flash crash with a larger contract, such as BTCUSDT perpetuals, there\u2019s potential for them to unfairly liquidate customer funds at significantly disadvantageous prices and then refuse to compensate. In such a case, they might say, \u201cThis was due to a chain of stop-loss triggers from our customers. But if the stop-loss was set using MarkPrice, it would have had no effect. Our derivative product worked as intended.\u201dThis is another example of a conflict of interest, where the counterparty risk works in their favor. Customers are left with no choice if they decide to manipulate the situation to their advantage.As we saw in 2022, when exchange \u201cF\u201d went bankrupt after misusing customer funds, most of the funds have still not been refunded.Bitget is an untrustworthy exchange. It\u2019s better to move to another crypto exchange or quit trading and keep your money in your own wallet."

Beyond that, if I ask any further questions, they simply send me a feedback request form without providing any actual responses. Are they trolling us? Since they haven\u2019t provided any answers, I don\u2019t see how they can be fairly evaluated. All I can say is: 0 stars, and that\u2019s it.Customer support (which seems more like a suppression unit) remains silent\u2014ignoring inquiries entirely.In the AMPL case, they froze our funds for three weeks, then retroactively took away our past realized profits and harmed customers through the AMPL rebase. They left the \"no-rebase\" product incomplete for two years, then suddenly changed the rules without giving customers a choice. This is clearly a conflict of interest.They avoid accountability and show no sincerity.When the recent BGB flash crash occurred, the company announced they would fully compensate customers for their losses, emphasizing \"trust.\" Perhaps this was because their losses weren\u2019t that large.However, in the case of a flash crash with a larger contract, such as BTCUSDT perpetuals, there\u2019s potential for them to unfairly liquidate customer funds at significantly disadvantageous prices and then refuse to compensate. In such a case, they might say, \u201cThis was due to a chain of stop-loss triggers from our customers. But if the stop-loss was set using MarkPrice, it would have had no effect. Our derivative product worked as intended.\u201dThis is another example of a conflict of interest, where the counterparty risk works in their favor. Customers are left with no choice if they decide to manipulate the situation to their advantage.As we saw in 2022, when exchange \u201cF\u201d went bankrupt after misusing customer funds, most of the funds have still not been refunded.Bitget is an untrustworthy exchange. It\u2019s better to move to another crypto exchange or quit trading and keep your money in your own wallet."

Beyond that, if I ask any further questions, they simply send me a feedback request form without providing any actual responses. Are they trolling us? Since they haven\u2019t provided any answers, I don\u2019t see how they can be fairly evaluated. All I can say is: 0 stars, and that\u2019s it.Customer support (which seems more like a suppression unit) remains silent\u2014ignoring inquiries entirely.In the AMPL case, they froze our funds for three weeks, then retroactively took away our past realized profits and harmed customers through the AMPL rebase. They left the \"no-rebase\" product incomplete for two years, then suddenly changed the rules without giving customers a choice. This is clearly a conflict of interest.They avoid accountability and show no sincerity.When the recent BGB flash crash occurred, the company announced they would fully compensate customers for their losses, emphasizing \"trust.\" Perhaps this was because their losses weren\u2019t that large.However, in the case of a flash crash with a larger contract, such as BTCUSDT perpetuals, there\u2019s potential for them to unfairly liquidate customer funds at significantly disadvantageous prices and then refuse to compensate. In such a case, they might say, \u201cThis was due to a chain of stop-loss triggers from our customers. But if the stop-loss was set using MarkPrice, it would have had no effect. Our derivative product worked as intended.\u201dThis is another example of a conflict of interest, where the counterparty risk works in their favor. Customers are left with no choice if they decide to manipulate the situation to their advantage.As we saw in 2022, when exchange \u201cF\u201d went bankrupt after misusing customer funds, most of the funds have still not been refunded.Bitget is an untrustworthy exchange. It\u2019s better to move to another crypto exchange or quit trading and keep your money in your own wallet."

Ok, he opened an account , we put 130 dollars and started to open deals. Then he said that there is an opportunity to make money on exchanging euros to dollars. I put a lot of money and we sent it to bidget, then a man called victor started to call me and forced to buy like he said a temporary LICENCE , then it wasn\u2019t enough, he forced me to buy an insurance saying the bank doesn\u2019t allow the transfer to my budget account. Then he said as my instructor put some money with me on my account , I had to send the exact money to unblock the account to be able to receive the transfer and that the following day before lunch I was going to receive the transfer. The following day he said want possible and I had to pay more, when I refused to pay he started to threaten that my accounts will be arrested! Please, can someone help? I am extremely disappointed and this is a total violation and fraud !! Until today I\u2019m still waiting my money back, a lot of money I was forced to pay!!!!"

After my mobile phone was stolen, my account was hacked, including all my passwords and Face ID of Bitget platform. To my horror, I received two emails from Bitget confirming unauthorized withdrawals from my account.Upon discovering this, I immediately contacted their support team to request that they block my account due to the unauthorized access. Instead of taking any serious action, I received a generic email stating that one of the later transactions had been canceled. I assumed my account was secure after this email, but I was sorely mistaken.Not only did Bitget fail to block my account properly, but they also allowed further withdrawals to happen, effectively draining my account through multiple transactions without any more emails alerting about withdraws. When I reached out to their support again, speaking with representatives named Paul and then Daniel, they completely dismissed my situation. They initially claimed that I had alerted them a day later, but I have the emails as proof with timestamps showing that I reported the incident immediately after the first two withdrawals\u2014before countless others could occur. They refused to take responsibility for the hacking incident or for their failure to adequately secure my account or notify me of continued unauthorized transactions.I am now left without years of savings, and I am pursuing legal action against Bitget. I strongly advise everyone to stay far away from this platform! Protect your hard-earned money and do not trust Bitget with your cryptocurrency investments."

                "review": "I cannot stress enough how terrible my experience with Bitget has been. While they claim to keep your cryptocurrencies safe, my experience proves it to be completely false. After my mobile phone was stolen, my account was hacked, including all my passwords and Face ID of Bitget platform. To my horror, I received two emails from Bitget confirming unauthorized withdrawals from my account.Upon discovering this, I immediately contacted their support team to request that they block my account due to the unauthorized access. Instead of taking any serious action, I received a generic email stating that one of the later transactions had been canceled. I assumed my account was secure after this email, but I was sorely mistaken.Not only did Bitget fail to block my account properly, but they also allowed further withdrawals to happen, effectively draining my account through multiple transactions without any more emails alerting about withdraws. When I reached out to their support again, speaking with representatives named Paul and then Daniel, they completely dismissed my situation. They initially claimed that I had alerted them a day later, but I have the emails as proof with timestamps showing that I reported the incident immediately after the first two withdrawals\u2014before countless others could occur. They refused to take responsibility for the hacking incident or for their failure to adequately secure my account or notify me of continued unauthorized transactions.I am now left without years of savings, and I am pursuing legal action against Bitget. I strongly advise everyone to stay far away from this platform! Protect your hard-earned money and do not trust Bitget with your cryptocurrency investments."

                "review": "I cannot stress enough how terrible my experience with Bitget has been. While they claim to keep your cryptocurrencies safe, my experience proves it to be completely false. After my mobile phone was stolen, my account was hacked, including all my passwords and Face ID of Bitget platform. To my horror, I received two emails from Bitget confirming unauthorized withdrawals from my account.Upon discovering this, I immediately contacted their support team to request that they block my account due to the unauthorized access. Instead of taking any serious action, I received a generic email stating that one of the later transactions had been canceled. I assumed my account was secure after this email, but I was sorely mistaken.Not only did Bitget fail to block my account properly, but they also allowed further withdrawals to happen, effectively draining my account through multiple transactions without any more emails alerting about withdraws. When I reached out to their support again, speaking with representatives named Paul and then Daniel, they completely dismissed my situation. They initially claimed that I had alerted them a day later, but I have the emails as proof with timestamps showing that I reported the incident immediately after the first two withdrawals\u2014before countless others could occur. They refused to take responsibility for the hacking incident or for their failure to adequately secure my account or notify me of continued unauthorized transactions.I am now left without years of savings, and I am pursuing legal action against Bitget. I strongly advise everyone to stay far away from this platform! Protect your hard-earned money and do not trust Bitget with your cryptocurrency investments."

I reached out to customer support several times via email, with my latest email sent on September 13, but I still haven\u2019t received a response.Although I believe Bitget is a good exchange and was interested in using it, the support experience has been extremely disappointing. Even for a simple issue like account access, it seems there\u2019s no effective assistance, and it\u2019s frustrating to wait for months without any resolution.

You, as a Chinese company, seem incapable of fulfilling your obligations and resort to marketing phrases and lies instead of providing real support. If you actually cared about your \u201cprecious\u201d customers, as you claim, this issue would have been resolved quickly. I make numerous trades and generate significant revenue for the app, yet you have failed to address my concerns properly.The amount I am claiming is quickly recovered through the fees you charge me, which is an undeniable fact.That said, I have already transferred all my funds to Binance. After receiving this unsatisfactory response from Bitget, let me make it clear that I no longer support your platform. On the contrary, I will be submitting complaints on App Store, Trustpilot, and also escalating this issue across social media, Telegram communities, and Twitter.Our paths won\u2019t cross again, and rest assured, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure no family, friend, or anyone I know ever uses this app."

Recently, I decided to log in again to start trading, only to find that my Google Authenticator had been removed from my phone, leaving me without access to the code.I tried multiple times to disable it via the Bitget website, but I was repeatedly asked the same questions and received an error saying my answers were incorrect. I reached out to customer support several times via email, with my latest email sent on September 13, but I still haven\u2019t received a response.Although I believe Bitget is a good exchange and was interested in using it, the support experience has been extremely disappointing. Even for a simple issue like account access, it seems there\u2019s no effective assistance, and it\u2019s frustrating to wait for months without any resolution. This has left me feeling truly let down by the platform."

You, as a Chinese company, seem incapable of fulfilling your obligations and resort to marketing phrases and lies instead of providing real support. If you actually cared about your \u201cprecious\u201d customers, as you claim, this issue would have been resolved quickly. I make numerous trades and generate significant revenue for the app, yet you have failed to address my concerns properly.The amount I am claiming is quickly recovered through the fees you charge me, which is an undeniable fact.That said, I have already transferred all my funds to Binance. After receiving this unsatisfactory response from Bitget, let me make it clear that I no longer support your platform. On the contrary, I will be submitting complaints on App Store, Trustpilot, and also escalating this issue across social media, Telegram communities, and Twitter.Our paths won\u2019t cross again, and rest assured, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure no family, friend, or anyone I know ever uses this app."

Recently, I decided to log in again to start trading, only to find that my Google Authenticator had been removed from my phone, leaving me without access to the code.I tried multiple times to disable it via the Bitget website, but I was repeatedly asked the same questions and received an error saying my answers were incorrect. I reached out to customer support several times via email, with my latest email sent on September 13, but I still haven\u2019t received a response.Although I believe Bitget is a good exchange and was interested in using it, the support experience has been extremely disappointing. Even for a simple issue like account access, it seems there\u2019s no effective assistance, and it\u2019s frustrating to wait for months without any resolution. This has left me feeling truly let down by the platform."

In contrast, negative reviews frequently focus on security issues, unauthorized transactions, and use terms like \"scam\" and \"blocked,\" indicating concerns over account safety and trust. The main themes include the importance of authenticity and specific details in positive reviews, while negative feedback underscores critical issues related to security and trustworthiness. To improve, companies should focus on enhancing security measures and ensuring transparent communication to address trust concerns. Further investigation could explore the root causes of security issues and develop strategies to prevent unauthorized transactions, thereby improving overall customer satisfaction.",

I make numerous trades and generate significant revenue for the app, yet you have failed to address my concerns properly.The amount I am claiming is quickly recovered through the fees you charge me, which is an undeniable fact.That said, I have already transferred all my funds to Binance. After receiving this unsatisfactory response from Bitget, let me make it clear that I no longer support your platform. On the contrary, I will be submitting complaints on App Store, Trustpilot, and also escalating this issue across social media, Telegram communities, and Twitter.Our paths won\u2019t cross again, and rest assured, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure no family, friend, or anyone I know ever uses this app."

Recently, I decided to log in again to start trading, only to find that my Google Authenticator had been removed from my phone, leaving me without access to the code.I tried multiple times to disable it via the Bitget website, but I was repeatedly asked the same questions and received an error saying my answers were incorrect. I reached out to customer support several times via email, with my latest email sent on September 13, but I still haven\u2019t received a response.Although I believe Bitget is a good exchange and was interested in using it, the support experience has been extremely disappointing. Even for a simple issue like account access, it seems there\u2019s no effective assistance, and it\u2019s frustrating to wait for months without any resolution. This has left me feeling truly let down by the platform."

You, as a Chinese company, seem incapable of fulfilling your obligations and resort to marketing phrases and lies instead of providing real support. If you actually cared about your \u201cprecious\u201d customers, as you claim, this issue would have been resolved quickly. I make numerous trades and generate significant revenue for the app, yet you have failed to address my concerns properly.The amount I am claiming is quickly recovered through the fees you charge me, which is an undeniable fact.That said, I have already transferred all my funds to Binance. After receiving this unsatisfactory response from Bitget, let me make it clear that I no longer support your platform. On the contrary, I will be submitting complaints on App Store, Trustpilot, and also escalating this issue across social media, Telegram communities, and Twitter.Our paths won\u2019t cross again, and rest assured, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure no family, friend, or anyone I know ever uses this app."

The second time, in addition to an awful lot of personal information, I had to submit a photo of my credit card, front and back. On the advice of my bank's lawyers, they said I should never do that. After notifying Bitget of this, they still maintain the claim. So this now means that my money is stuck or trapped and I will probably never get it back. After all, it's my own money.So that's why I warn everyone, never transfer money to Bitget, they steal it as soon as they see it. I regard them as robbers and thievesI am far from satisfied with Bitget's attempt to prevent a real answer. It is not in accordance with international law to require a copy of both the front and back of my credit card in order to release my own money from their account. Therefore, I maintain my warning. Never deposit money into their accounts, because you risk never getting the money back. I will now inform the police and Consumer Europe about my experience. so I hope that this type of fraud can stop"

The second time, in addition to an awful lot of personal information, I had to submit a photo of my credit card, front and back. On the advice of my bank's lawyers, they said I should never do that. After notifying Bitget of this, they still maintain the claim. So this now means that my money is stuck or trapped and I will probably never get it back. After all, it's my own money.So that's why I warn everyone, never transfer money to Bitget, they steal it as soon as they see it. I regard them as robbers and thievesI am far from satisfied with Bitget's attempt to prevent a real answer. It is not in accordance with international law to require a copy of both the front and back of my credit card in order to release my own money from their account. Therefore, I maintain my warning. Never deposit money into their accounts, because you risk never getting the money back. I will now inform the police and Consumer Europe about my experience. so I hope that this type of fraud can stop"

The second time, in addition to an awful lot of personal information, I had to submit a photo of my credit card, front and back. On the advice of my bank's lawyers, they said I should never do that. After notifying Bitget of this, they still maintain the claim. So this now means that my money is stuck or trapped and I will probably never get it back. After all, it's my own money.So that's why I warn everyone, never transfer money to Bitget, they steal it as soon as they see it. I regard them as robbers and thievesI am far from satisfied with Bitget's attempt to prevent a real answer. It is not in accordance with international law to require a copy of both the front and back of my credit card in order to release my own money from their account. Therefore, I maintain my warning. Never deposit money into their accounts, because you risk never getting the money back. I will now inform the police and Consumer Europe about my experience. so I hope that this type of fraud can stop"

The second time, in addition to an awful lot of personal information, I had to submit a photo of my credit card, front and back. On the advice of my bank's lawyers, they said I should never do that. After notifying Bitget of this, they still maintain the claim. So this now means that my money is stuck or trapped and I will probably never get it back. After all, it's my own money.So that's why I warn everyone, never transfer money to Bitget, they steal it as soon as they see it. I regard them as robbers and thievesI am far from satisfied with Bitget's attempt to prevent a real answer. It is not in accordance with international law to require a copy of both the front and back of my credit card in order to release my own money from their account. Therefore, I maintain my warning. Never deposit money into their accounts, because you risk never getting the money back. I will now inform the police and Consumer Europe about my experience. so I hope that this type of fraud can stop"

After reaching out to the support team, I was informed that my account was under review due to suspicious activity, and access was limited. Despite multiple follow-ups with support, I was unable to receive detailed information about the cause of the review or an estimated timeline for resolution.This issue occurred during a time of significant market volatility, and I urgently needed access to my assets. The lack of timely information and the restriction on my account has not only caused considerable financial and emotional stress but also created a sense of distrust toward similar platforms.I hope this experience serves as a reminder to other users and exchanges about the importance of clear communication and prompt responses in such cases. I am still waiting for the resolution of my account's restriction and hope it will be resolved soon."

After reaching out to the support team, I was informed that my account was under review due to suspicious activity, and access was limited. Despite multiple follow-ups with support, I was unable to receive detailed information about the cause of the review or an estimated timeline for resolution.This issue occurred during a time of significant market volatility, and I urgently needed access to my assets. The lack of timely information and the restriction on my account has not only caused considerable financial and emotional stress but also created a sense of distrust toward similar platforms.I hope this experience serves as a reminder to other users and exchanges about the importance of clear communication and prompt responses in such cases. I am still waiting for the resolution of my account's restriction and hope it will be resolved soon."

After reaching out to the support team, I was informed that my account was under review due to suspicious activity, and access was limited. Despite multiple follow-ups with support, I was unable to receive detailed information about the cause of the review or an estimated timeline for resolution.This issue occurred during a time of significant market volatility, and I urgently needed access to my assets. The lack of timely information and the restriction on my account has not only caused considerable financial and emotional stress but also created a sense of distrust toward similar platforms.I hope this experience serves as a reminder to other users and exchanges about the importance of clear communication and prompt responses in such cases. I am still waiting for the resolution of my account's restriction and hope it will be resolved soon."
